    <em>
        The title and words of the old spiritual “Ride on, King Jesus” recall
        the day when Jesus was received into Jerusalem as king. The welcome of
        Jesus into the holy city on the Sunday before His crucifixion has long
        been called the triumphal entry. This event is found in all four of the
        Gospels, each having some unique details. Although the Gospel does not
        make any reference to this event as a “triumph,” it does bear some
        relationship to the ancient custom of welcoming a victorious king or
        general back to his home city. The city of Rome had a tradition of
        staging triumphal processions. This parade would include the Roman
        legions, enemy prisoners, wagons loaded with booty, and the victorious
        general in a special chariot. Sometimes a new triumphal arch would be
        created. This custom was revived by the French emperor Napoleon
        Bonaparte, whose Arc de Triomphe in Paris was commissioned in 1806 for
        the glory of the French army. The triumphal entry of Jesus was a way of
        recognizing Him as king. What does it mean for us today? This week’s
        lesson will examine some of the implications involved in recognizing
        Jesus as King in our lives.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The King Revealed (Luke 19:28-35). </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The focus of Christianity is on Jesus Christ. The only begotten Son of God,
    who came to redeem humanity from corruption and eternal damnation of the
    fallen world, granting us the hope and gift of eternal life. The Bible is
    full of references to the revealing of Jesus as the Messiah. Isaiah
    declared that the Saviour would come seeking after His own people, to
    cleanse and purify them. He would also give reward to the faithful (Isaiah
    62:11). Zachariah portrays Him as the King coming to comfort His people
    (Zech. 9:9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The visit of Jesus to Jerusalem was a graceful one. It was very significant
    because of the events that followed. It was so glamorous that people
    trooped out to catch a glimpse of the great King. A short influential man,
    Zaccheaus had to climb a tree just to have an opportunity of seeing the
    approaching King (Luke 19:1-4). The crowd also struggled to see Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus had come from Jericho, a short distance from Jerusalem at Bethphage
    and Bethany. When it was time for Him to go up to Jerusalem, He prepared
    His way for the entry. He stopped at a point to prepare a means of entering
    the city that people would know He was presenting Himself as the Messiah.
    He commanded two of His disciples to find a donkey and a colt and bring
    them to Him. If anyone questioned their actions, they were to say the Lord
    needed them. As Messiah, He had the right to request whatever He needed.
    Matthew mentioned in 21: 4-5, that this act fulfilled divine prophecy:
    Zechariah 9:9 (cf. Isa 62:11), which spoke to the nation of Israel about
    the coming of her King in a gentle manner riding on... a colt, the foal
    (lit., son) of a donkey. This was not the normal manner in which kings
    arrived, for they usually came as conquerors riding on horses. A colt was a
    symbol of peace.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    After the disciples got the animals, they threw their garments on them to
    make saddles, and people in the large crowd spread their cloaks and tree
    branches on the road. Most of these people were pilgrims from Galilee on
    their way to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover. They were familiar with
    Jesus and the many miracles He had performed in Galilee.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The King Received (Luke 19:35-40). </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    What a glorious and happy day, the King of kings, the Lord of lords openly
    rode on the common street of Jerusalem. He was greeted with high funfair
    and salutation,
    <strong>
        <em>
            "'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!' Peace in
            heaven and glory in the highest!" (Luke 19:38).
        </em>
    </strong>
    He was riding on a colt in a royal majesty and humility as a caring King.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Then, as He was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of
            Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
            praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had
            seen,” (Luke 19:37).
        </em>
    </strong>
    The coming of the King was a consolation, to give comfort to His people.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The crowd in Jerusalem welcomed Jesus. He was hailed as the Messiah on what
    Christians call "Palm Sunday." Jesus' enemies were aroused by this event,
    and renewed their attacks against Him. Jesus silenced them and in turn
    boldly condemned their wickedness and hypocrisy. Jesus responded that there
    must be some proclamation that He is the Messiah, if not, even inanimate
    objects (stones) would be called on to testify for Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As the people walked along, some before Jesus and some behind Him, they
    were probably singing some of the pilgrim psalms. Matthew 21:15 noted that
    the people, including children, shouted the words of
    <strong>
        <em>
            Psalms 118:26, “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord…”
        </em>
    </strong>
    To Him they shouted, Hosanna to the Son of David. "Hosanna" is from the
    Hebrew, meaning, "Save (us), we pray," taken from Ps 118:25. It came to be
    a note of praise as well as petition.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    While the crowd did not fully understand the significance of this event,
    they seemed to be acknowledging that this One is the promised Seed of David
    who had come to grant them salvation. Both their actions and words bestowed
    honour on this One coming into the city, at last presenting Himself
    publicly as their King. This event marked the official presentation of
    Jesus Christ to the nation of Israel as the rightful Son of David.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament. It points to the coming
    of the Messiah. Many O/T writers wrote about Him as the promised Messiah.
    Everything about His life and ministry were predicted. The Gospel of
    Matthew did a good justice to this, pointing out every reference with,
    “that it might be fulfilled …”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As Jesus advanced down the west side of the Mount of Olives towards the
    city, He was praised by the crowd as their Messiah. The act of spreading
    their cloaks on the road in front of Jesus was a sign of respect. The whole
    crowd of people began joyfully to praise God... for all the miracles
    (evidences of spiritual power) they had seen. The Pharisees understood the
    meaning of what was going on, for they told Jesus to rebuke His followers,
    so they would stop calling Him Messiah or King. Jesus responded that there
    must be some proclamation that He is the Messiah. If not, even inanimate
    objects (stones) would be called on to testify for Him. All history had
    pointed towards this single, spectacular event when the Messiah publicly
    presented Himself to the nation, and God desired that this fact be
    acknowledged.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The triumphal entry of Jesus into the city of Jerusalem caused the whole
    city to stand still, a symbol of respect and honour to a great King /
    authority. Jesus must be honoured and welcome in our lives, homes, cities
    and in everything.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    He was heralded with great cry; riding on a colt which signifies royalty,
    humility, meekness and simplicity. Pride comes before a fall because it is
    an abomination before God. We must emulate the simplicity, meekness and
    humility of Jesus.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    His popularity among the people stirred up the jealousy and indignation of
    the Pharisees who tried to stop the people from praising and honouring
    Jesus. This teaches us that our conviction of faith in Jesus should make us
    stand steadfast even in the midst of persecution. We should remain
    steadfast and immovable as children of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus did not take action as a military conqueror to prove that His kingdom
    is spiritual. We don’t need to show-off, but allow God to have His way in
    our lives. We should also be moderate and temperate in all things.

        Jesus entering into Jerusalem was predicted by prophet Zachariah (Zech.

        The use of colt symbolizes humility and care. It also signifies that

    <em>
        The cornerstone of the Christian faith is the teaching on the death and
        resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is absolutely essential to individual
        salvation and the formation of the church. Yet this truth was the most
        difficult for the disciples of Jesus to grasp. Whenever He introduced
        the subject to prepare them, He met either vigorous objection or total
        lack of understanding. The lack of comprehension still existed as Jesus
        approached the cross. He had to explain to the Twelve what lies beyond
        His death. Even after His resurrection, He had to counter the unbelief
        of Mary Magdalene and other loyal followers. May our faith be
        strengthened by the truths He taught them. <strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Preparation (John 16:16-24)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Great men or leaders used to prepare for their departure from earth by
    setting things and their houses in order. This is done mainly to ensure
    sanity, peace and harmony among those they leave behind. Modern days permit
    and even encourage the writing of ‘Will’. Many families has suffered, even
    still suffering untold hardship, conflict, division and enmity due to the
    demise of their benefactor, who died intestate. When King Hezekiah was sick
    unto death, God sent a prophet to advise him to set his house in order (2
    Kings 20:1). We need to prepare for the eventualities.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus Christ, as a great leader, made concerted efforts to prepare His
    disciples for His mission on earth – to suffer persecution, die on the
    cross, and be raised again on the third day. He desired that His disciples
    would have an understanding of what would befall Him, so that they would
    not be taken unawares, but their understanding was darkened. They were
    blindfolded by unbelief.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In John 16:16-22, Jesus was referring to His death, which was a few days
    away, and His resurrection three days after. At the garden of Gethsemane,
    Jesus prayed for Peter that his faith be strengthened and he should be able
    to strengthen others. Despite Jesus’ attempt at making His disciples have
    spiritual knowledge of divine agenda concerning Him, they rejected it
    because it didn’t sound rational; probably because it involved suffering,
    pain and reproach, hardship and death. A great lesson we need to learn is
    that because something does not sound pleasing, appears unattractive,
    involves suffering or challenges, does not mean God is not involved. James
    admonishes us to count it all joy when we fall into diverse temptations.
    Trials and temptations give faith the opportunity to grow &amp; develop
    (James 1:2-4). Faith is not faith until it is tried. Proverb 24:10 says
    <strong>
        <em>
            , “If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.”
            (Prov. 24:10).

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Empty Tomb (John 20:1-18) </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus was crucified according to the predetermined counsel of God, as the
    Lamb that takes away the sins of the world. The resurrection took place on
    the third day according to predictions. However, the arrest, trials and
    crucifixion of Jesus put the disciples into a state of confusion and
    uncertainty, as a result of their lack of understanding of the Messianic
    prophecy being fulfilled in their sight. To walk with God, we need divine
    revelation and insight.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    On the resurrection morning, the first day of the week (Sunday), Mary
    Magdalene was at the tomb, only to find it empty. The stone had been rolled
    away, for all to see clearly that Jesus was no longer in the grave. Peter
    and John also came to witness to it. Peter entered the tomb to discover the
    linen wrappings lying there, which was a pointer to the fact that Jesus had
    resurrected. (John 20:8-9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The concept of resurrection is a mystery. A first time hearer of the word
    is likely to disbelieve, regarding it as fallacy or fable. If he
    experiences visiting the empty tomb, he may come to a state of confusion.
    However, if he has an encounter with the resurrected Christ, like Mary
    Magdalene, he may be convinced. But if he commits himself in seeking God
    and serving Him, his faith would be established, and become a sure
    candidate of God’s eternal kingdom (John 8:31).

    The redemptive plan involves the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus

    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    During His last days of earthly ministry, Jesus Christ was preparing His
    disciples for His departure,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
            while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.” (John
            16:16).
        </em>
    </strong>
    The statement was bewildering to the disciples. The questions they asked
    themselves indicated that they were confused. However, only His death,
    resurrection, post-resurrection ministry, and ascension would make it all
    clear.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It indicates that we need spiritual discernment to comprehend divine
    instruction, leading and guidance. We should always seek for clarity of
    vision to succeed in our walk with God. God speaks sometimes in parables,
    symbols, imageries, etc. Hence, we need divine understanding to comprehend
    His message. The purpose of God is revealed per time and we need to move
    with the leading of the Spirit in order to keep pace with divine agenda.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus made an illustration of pain replaced by joy with the pain of child
    birth, which is followed by the joy of new life when a child is born. We
    need perseverance, endurance and patience in our daily walk with God. The
    present problems and challenges will become history tomorrow. When the
    disciples saw Jesus after His resurrection, their joy erupted. ‘Joy that
    will never end since He died to sin once but now lives forevermore’ (Rom.
    6:9-10, Luke 24:33-52, Hebrews 7:24-25).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early on Sunday morning. ‘Her devotion to
    Jesus, in life and in death, was based on her gratitude for His delivering
    her from the bondage of Satan. She had been an observer when Jesus was
    nailed on the cross and now the first person at the grave. Jesus’ proverb
    comes to mind
    <em>
        , <strong>“</strong>Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are
        many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,

    The statement of Jesus in preparing the disciples for His departure was not
    immediately understood as they questioned among themselves the meaning. The
    Master understood their confusion, but did not give clarity, knowing that
    they would come to understanding as the event unfolds. Rather, He gave
    solemn prediction that their coming grief would be followed by joy. His
    death would be bitter agony for them but the world would be happy over it.
    Nevertheless, His death would bring gladness to them eventually, as their
    grief would turn to joy (1 Cor. 1:23, 2:2). Furthermore, He gave an
    illustration of a woman in travail of birth,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
            come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth
            no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.”
            (John 16:21).
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All the Gospels relate the story, stressing certain aspects of the event of
    the empty tomb. However, John reveals a personal faith in the resurrection
    by considering the evidence found in the open tomb (John 20:1-9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    On Sunday, the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene (also called Mary of
    Magdala) came early in the morning to the tomb, but found it opened. The
    tomb was closed with a large rock door (Mark 16:3-4), and sealed by the
    authority of the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate (Matt. 27:15-16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It was amazing to see the tomb opened and empty. They might have assumed
    that grave robbers had desecrated the tomb.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Peter and John ran to the tomb. When Peter rushed in, he saw the grave
    clothes and burial cloth separated. The position of the grave clothes and
    burial clothes ruled out the possibility of grave robbery. The opened tomb
    was not to allow the body of Jesus to go out, but an evidence to let the
disciples and the world see that Jesus had indeed risen as predicted.    <strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Introduction:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        We believe that evangelizing and making disciples is the primary
        “business” of the church; every hindrance to worldwide evangelism
        should be removed (James 5:20; Mark 16:15).
    </em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Today’s lesson is to stir up our hearts to fresh commitment to this
    important business of God which is gradually being consigned to few
    brethren. It must be stressed that evangelism is a general mandate that
    concerns all believers. Unfortunately, today’s believers are being
    encumbered by a lot of activities in the church which more or less give
    little or no room for evangelism. Many believers are very fearful that the
    available opportunities and platforms for them to reach out to others,
    especially in the market place are not utilized; others do not even know
    how to ‘preach’. It is often imagined that evangelism has to involve expert
    knowledge of the Bible. It is important for this lesson to clearly
    articulate God’s intention for mankind to be reached by the gospel of our
    Lord Jesus Christ, which does not require expert knowledge of man but
    desire to reach the Lost, simplicity and dependence on the Holy Spirit for
    unction.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As a matter of fact, our business as believers is to be sensitive to
    discern who to reach, when and where to do so and God’s business is to save
    the Lost.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    The <strong>Nature and Hindrances to the Gospel</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The greatest enemy of the Gospel is the devil. He can do anything to ensure
    the gospel which is the power of God unto salvation to all men is not
    preached. The devil does not mind to give anything as long as the soul is
    not liberated. When the devil appeared to the Lord, he showed Him the
    kingdoms of the world and the glory thereof and promised to give Him
    everything, if only He could bow to worship him. (Matt. 4:8-9) Of course,
    the Lord rebuked him. Today, many believers are losing grounds as the devil
    is busy trading their souls with mundane things of this world. The love of
    many is waxing cold and preaching the gospel is becoming burdensome. There
    is need for every Christian to wake up and dismantle the instrument of
    wickedness that Satan is employing to stop the preaching of the gospel. It
    is very necessary for us to understand that some of the methods employed by
    our arch enemy, Satan, include the following:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Disobedience</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This is a great tool in the hand of the devil against the preaching of the
    Gospel. Many believers today do not realize that when God gives a
    commandment, it must be strictly obeyed.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the military, it’s a great offence that attracts severe punishment for
    an order given by a superior officer to be flouted. There is need to
    understand that our God is sovereign and supreme. One of the Commandments
    given by God in the Bible is “Go ye into all the world and preach the
    gospel unto every creature” (Mark 16:15). It is almost inconceivable that
    an order given by a senior to a junior in in rank would not be obeyed.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We need to break down the wall of self will and begin to make important
    what God commanded in the bible. Evangelism is not optional, it is
    compulsory for all Christians to go out and reconcile the sinning world to
    Christ (II Cor. 5:18-19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Fear and Intimidation</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Many Christians are afraid of going out because of fear of being attacked
    or harassed. Some are even afraid that they do not know what to say. The
    Bible is also clear on some of these things. The truth is that, he that
    loves his life will lose it. (John 12:25). Also, there is no fear in love,
    for perfect love castest out fear because fear has torment and he that
    feareth is not made perfect in love (1John 4:18). Whenever you are going
    out to preach, all you need to do is pray and depend on God and He will
    take charge of the situation. God has promised to fill our mouth when we
    open it. (Ps. 81:10). We are in a world that is hostile and wicked, but God
    is able to protect us from the forces of darkness. There is need to be
    filled with the Holy Spirit which gives boldness.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Pride</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Many consider evangelism as menial and should be done by people that are
    not old or positioned like them. Of course, pride makes a man feel too
    conscious of himself rather than what God is demanding. God indeed resists
    the proud but gives more grace to the humble (James 4:6). It is time to
    dismantle this unnecessary self-consciousness of our status and position
    and humble ourselves to work like the Lord Jesus did.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>Distraction</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are in a world where distraction has become a big tool the devil uses to
    prevent Christians, especially young people from serving God. Today, the
    world of internet, television, social media and communication has made so
    many people to lose interest in going out to preach the gospel as
    instructed by the Lord. Many of the communication gadgets have become too
    addictive. Today, Christians are setting wrong priorities.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Authority and Scope of the Great Commission</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>We are backed by the Greatest Authority</strong>
    .
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the power behind the preaching of the gospel. There is no limitation
    to what God can do when the gospel is preached. Jesus declared that All
    power in heaven and on earth have been given unto Him. In this effect, our
    business is to obey, while God’s business is to save. God can through the
    preaching of the gospel save, heal and even deliver. He may decide to
    encounter the worst of sinners and destroy the stronghold ruling
    communities. Simon the sorcerer was saved when Philip decided to preach in
    Samaria. This very manipulative sorcerer was saved and baptized and even
    began to follow the apostles (Acts 8:9, 18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>We are to preach the gospel all over the world.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The gospel is to be preached from village to village until it reaches the
    entire world. One of the cardinal factors that will herald the coming of
    the Lord is the preaching of the gospel round the entire world. (Matt.
    24:14). We believers have been entrusted to carry out this important
    assignment. The best approach is to start from our Jerusalem and progress
    gradually to our Judea, and then to Samaria and finally, to the entire
    world. The implication is that some may have to preach in the villages,
    whilst some may preach in the cities and others may have to take the gospel
    abroad. The light of the gospel must shine through all nooks and cranny.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Types of Evangelism</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Out Door Evangelism</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Every opportunity must be utilized to spread the gospel by every believer.
    Usually, the platform has to involve some form of strategy to reach some
    people who may never even step into the church on their own. There is need
    to intentionally reach out to them. Like fishers of men that we are as
    believers, we need to spread our dragnets to catch all kinds of fish.
    Whatever method we use in Outdoor Evangelism, there is need to stress that
    Jesus must be preached. We must never lose the consciousness of this
    important fact. Some of the modes of Outdoor evangelism include the
    following: Door to Door, Medical Missions, Open Air Crusades, Road shows,
    Bus, School, Hospital, Prisons, Old People’s, Home and Social Media
    Evangelism.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Market and Work Place Evangelism</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The work place is a veritable platform to preach the gospel. Every believer
    that desires to effectively preach the gospel in the market place must
    stand out. Indeed, Christians are God’s epistles written by the Spirit and
    not ink, but read by all men. Therefore, market evangelism should start
    with a conscious desire to stand out as God’s representative in that market
    and place of work. There may be need for the believers to start from “one
    on one” basis, by preaching to our colleagues, subordinates, superiors and
    even clients as the case may be. Do not devote the time for work in the
    office to do this. Rather, set aside time, especially your break period for
    the assignment to avoid being accused of spending employers time on
    preaching. Where the atmosphere is conducive either in the market or
    workplace, you may prayerfully establish a lunch hour fellowship. In most
    markets in Nigeria, early hours of Thursday have been set aside for
    cleaning of the markets. You may have to target how you can get a fraction
    of the time to do the Master’s business.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>The Result and effects Of Witnessing</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Indeed, witnessing would bring great yield on the church, the society at
    large with longer implication on eternity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A. <strong>Witnessing would bring many souls to church.</strong> Many of
    our churches today are empty because we have discounted this important
    assignment. The more evangelism we carry out, the more souls would be won
    for the Lord, and ultimately, these souls would become part of the church
    for discipleship. There is need for the church to wage war against empty
    chairs and go out to the highways and hedges to bring men into God’s house.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    B. <strong>Witnessing would bring a saner society.</strong> Today’s society
    is full of wickedness. Every day, the Newspapers scream of atrocities
    committed by men. The truth is that when God removes the heart of stone
    from a man and implants the heart of flesh, the man becomes transformed.
    The greatest change agent in any society is the spread of the gospel. In
    our country today, able bodied men are jobless and many of these things
    resort to frustration which can best be managed through the gospel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    C. Witnessing would save sinners and believers from the wrath of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Today, the world is full of evil. In many communities, people can hardly
    sleep in the night because of the men of the underworld. The day also has
    her fair share of wickedness. We are in a generation where blood shedding
    is no more conscionable. Killings, rituals, abortions, kidnappings are all
    prevalent in our world. The way out is for the light of God to shine to
    remove darkness from the hearts of men. Our lesson is a confirmation that
    God is depending on the church to shine the light by preaching Jesus. The
    church must be ready to give this assignment the attention that it deserves
    without which the world would continue to wallow in self destructive
    attitude that has both serious earthly and eternal consequences on both the
    sinning world and the uncaring church.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussions:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Why do you think evangelism is so important to God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Discuss the weapons that Satan uses to prevent the preaching of the
    gospel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. What are the likely consequences of refusing to preach the gospel in our
    communities and work places.

        “business” of the church; every hindrance to worldwide evangelism
        should be removed (Jam. 5:20; Mk. 16:15). Our family members are also
        inclusive in our commission of evangelizing the world.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Evangelism within the Family</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The family unit has ever been the focus in evangelism. The church itself is
    a family. It comprises members of God’s family (Believers). The Church is
    the body of Christ. I Corinthians 12:12-14 says,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members
            of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For
            by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — whether Jews or
            Greeks, whether slaves or free — and have all been made to drink
            into one Spirit. For in fact the body is not one member but many.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    Evangelism can be described as calling into the body of Christ those who
    are destined for redemption (i.e. calling together the members of Christ’s
    family). Going out to call and bringing them into the fold.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The creation story started with one family (Adam and Eve) in the Garden of
    Eden. When God destroyed the then existing world with water, He saved a
    family (Noah) and He used the family to repopulate the world (Gen. 7:1,
    8:1, 9:1). In the same pattern, the plan for redemption began with one
    family (Abraham, Gen. 12:1-3). The easiest way to populate the church is to
    win families: focusing on family evangelism.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    One of the methods of evangelism is to reach out to members of our family.
    In John 1:40-42, Andrew introduced his family member to Jesus
    <strong>
        <em>
            , “He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have
            found the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ). And he
            brought him to Jesus…”
        </em>
    </strong>
    The big question is, “How many members of your family have you brought to
    Jesus? Joshua declared,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “… But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord" (Joshua
            24:15).

    <strong>Evangelism within the Church/Missions Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Great Commission by the Master demands,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them
            in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
            teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and
            lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age" Amen. (Matt
            28:19-20)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The church has the divine mandate to reach the unreached and to perfect the
    saints. Different means and methods are employed in evangelism.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>Mass Evangelism:</strong>
    This involves a large scale means of evangelism. It includes open air
    crusade e.g. AWAKE programme, Holy Ghost Refreshing Vigil, Prayer or
    Musical Concert.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Medical Outreach:</strong>
    Where free medical services are provided for people. Doctors are made
    available to render free consultation services, free drugs are provided,
    sometimes free simple tests are conducted (e.g. blood pressure, sugar
    level, blood group, eye test etc.), free recommended glasses could be
    supplied.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>Give them food to eat:</strong>
    Sometimes called “Full Gospel” or “Stomach Infrastructure”. Free food is
    provided; food stuff and edible provisions are given out.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>Social Welfare:</strong>
    It includes community services, humanitarian services, sponsorship
    programme, financial aids/assistance, Educational Trust Fund (ETF),
    empowerment training, etc., meant to add value to people’s lives are used
    as means of attracting people to the Kingdom of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>5. </strong>
    <strong>External Ministries:</strong>
    It involves outreaches to places outside the church wall. The idea is to
    take the gospel to the people where they are. This requires some
    understanding and training to engage in these ministries/mission, e.g.
    Hospital Ministry, Prison Ministry, Schools &amp; Colleges, Orphanages, Old
    People’s Homes, Foster Homes, Welfare Centres (Matt. 25:31-46).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>6. </strong>
    <strong>One on One Evangelism:</strong>
    It involves reaching out to people one on one. It allows for personal
    touch, freedom of expression and feelings. The Master Himself introduced
    this method when He sent His disciples out (Matt. 10:1; Luke 9:1-2). “After
these things, the Lord appointed seventy others also,    <u>and sent them two by two</u> before His face into every city and place
    where He Himself was about to go” (Luke 10:1).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>7. </strong>
    <strong>Special Programme:</strong>
    Special evangelistic or revival programme could be organized in the church
    that appeals to special need, attention or attraction of the community.
    E.g. Traditional Sunday, Unusual Sunday, Revival Programme, Special Healing
    Service, Guest Sunday, Empowerment Programme, Mission Sunday.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Every believer is called to preach the gospel. The Great Commission is a
    commandment for all to go and not a suggestion. God has given man (not
    angels) the mandate and responsibility to populate His kingdom here on
    earth through evangelism. Every believer must have an obsession for
    evangelism. It must fill your heart constantly. Think it, talk it and act
    it. It should be our heart beat as it is of God’s. We must seize every
    opportunity to share the gospel. We are saved to do the ministry of
    reconciliation (Eph. 4:11-13; 2 Cor. 5: 18-20).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The will of God is for all men to be saved [John 3:16; Rom 5:8; 1Tim 2:1-4;
    2Pet. 3:8-9]. The focus of the Great Commission is to bring souls to the
    kingdom of God,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “... but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear
            fruit, and that your fruit should remain ...”
        </em>
    </strong>
    (John 15:16). For our fruit to remain, evangelism, witnessing, visitation
    and follow-up must go hand-in-hand.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Evangelism comes from the word ‘evangelize’ which is translated from the
    Greek word EVANGELIZO. It is made up of two words [1] EVS i.e. good and [2]
    AGGELLO i.e. to bring tidings. It means to bring good tidings\news,
    especially of the scripture. That is, to preach the gospel (Luke 4:43; Acts
    5:42; Rom. 1:15). Another Greek word ‘KERUSSO’ is used for evangelism. It
    means to herald, proclaim, publish [Mark 16:15].
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Evangelism and witnessing is reaching out to the dying world with the
    gospel of Jesus Christ; declaring the Good News, mercy and love of God to
    the lost and thus bringing or reconciling them back to God [2 Cor.
    5:17-21]. It also means:
</p>

    <li>
        Convincing the sinner of the love of God and how God desires him/her to
        come into relationship and fellowship.
    </li>
    <li>
        Working with Jesus to bring into fruition the purpose of incarnation.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Great Mandate;</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The mandate we received is from the Lord. It was given at the twilight of
    His ascension. It is therefore a very important message that must not be
    ignored. The task of preaching the gospel cannot be delegated. The church
    must live to the expectation of the Lord. However, there are some important
    aspects of this mandate that must be addressed.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A. <strong>We received a worldwide Assignment</strong>:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The task is to reach out to the entire world bringing the light of the
    gospel through effective evangelism. We need to be strategic as soldiers of
    the Lord. Before the soldiers of this world would prosecute any war, they
    would naturally plan, delineate and map out areas based on accessibility
    and other key factors. They will also consider available resources that may
    enhance performance on the battle field. It is also imperative for the
    church as soldiers of Christ to strategize, delineate and consider the
    resource at our disposal. The work can be categorized into two at the first
    instance which may include the areas of immediate influence i.e our
    communities, schools, workplace and neighbourhood. The second category may
    include places outside our areas of immediate influence. Today, our
    evangelical tools and approaches will depend on how we categorize the
    environment. It may be possible to reach out immediate vicinity with door
    to door evangelism, crusades and medical missions. However, for areas
    delineated as outside our immediate influence, we may need to deploy other
    tools such as media evangelism.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    B. <strong>We are to start in our Jerusalem: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
The believers must be ready to start the work in our little corners.    <strong> </strong>Every Christian has a Jerusalem. There is a place God has
    planted us to exert some measure of influence. This may be our
    neighbourhood, schools, workplace or communities where we live. Every
    church also has a Jerusalem. The community where the church is sited is our
    immediate area of influence. It is necessary to start in our Jerusalem. It
    is the model for the early church. They started in their Jerusalem but
    didn’t remain permanently there. The work entails preaching the gospel of
    Christ by whatever mode that is most effective while ensuring nurture and
    discipleship of souls won to maturity. The souls must also be encouraged to
    begin to work for the Master.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    C.
    <strong>
        We are to progressively move from our Jerusalem to other areas
        (Worldwide):
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The work of the church in evangelism is expected to start in our Jerusalem
    but it must not end there. The early church
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    started in Jerusalem and attempted to stop and continue in fellowship and
    breaking of bread but when persecution came, they were scattered abroad
    preaching the gospel wherever they went (Acts 8:1).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We need to learn our lessons, the work of evangelism for a church must not
    stop at our Jerusalem. We must ensure it progressively moves from our
    Jerusalem to our Judea, our Samaria and the uttermost parts of the world.
    Though it is good to evangelize and disciple souls in our churches and
    communities, we must also embark on mission work to unreached areas outside
    our immediate areas of influence. This could be done through mobilization
    for places that the Lord may be leading us. We can encourage our brethren
    to be part by giving financial and other resources that will assist the
    work. We can also be part of the work by groaning and praying consistently
    with burden for communities that are still under the yoke of the devil to
    receive the glorious light of the gospel. Finally, we can also be part of
    mission work by going either on temporary or permanent basis. To go on
    temporary basis is to set aside time, especially our holidays to travel to
    Muslim and other unreached fields to encourage brethren on the frontline.
    However, if we have a leading to go on permanent basis, it means like Paul
    of old, we have counted all things for loss to fully commit to the work of
    the Master in the field.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Great Outpouring.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is a fact that we are not sufficient on our own (John 15:5; II Cor.
    3:5). The enormity of the task must never be contemplated with our natural
    strength. The scriptures counselled that kings should never go to war
    without considering the resources at their disposal (Luke 14:28) whether it
    is sufficient to match that of the adversary. Graciously, the Lord has
    given us sufficient resources that will help us to effectively do the work.
    The good thing is that our enemy, the devil, does not have strength to
    stand against what the Lord has graciously given to the church. Let us
    examine this in details:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of witness.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Believers have been graciously empowered through the baptism of the Holy
    Spirit. It is very imperative for every Christian to receive the baptism of
    Holy Spirit with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues. Believers
    that are filled with the Holy Spirit (The third Person of the Eternal
    Godhead) become invested with the power to witness effectively. One of the
    major reasons the Lord sent the Holy Spirit after His ascension is to
    enable us to witness. The Holy Spirit has a capacity to quicken our
    understanding and enhance our depth of the word of God. The Holy Spirit
    also places a burden to witness in our hearts. This is a very important
    work that the Holy Spirit does in our life. It enables us to in turn
    witness to unbelievers irrespective of their status and race.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Boldness.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    One of the greatest work that the Holy Spirit does in the life of man is to
    transform him. Many times, an erstwhile timid, shy and fearful person,
    after receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit becomes burdened and
    courageous to preach. He stands tall and bold. The Holy Spirit gives
    boldness and destroys timidity and fear. (I Tim. 1:7; Acts 4:13) No doubt,
    we have more than enough resources to counter the enemy. Let us ask for
    investiture of the Holy Spirit upon our lives, and by extension, on the
    church, so that the gospel can be preached without limitation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Power.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The preaching of the gospel must be backed with accompanying signs and
    wonders. The kingdom is not in word alone but in demonstration of power. (I
    Cor. 4:20). The people will not believe if they do not see the signs. The
    Apostles of old came back with rejoicing when they saw the signs and
    wonders that followed their ministry. We need also to manifest the power as
    we preach the gospel. The sick must be healed and yokes must be broken. We
    thank God that we have received a great outpouring that can make us
    accomplish this while on our assignment. The Holy Spirit has been given to
    the church to make our task of preaching the gospel easier. When we get to
    any community and in the process of preaching the gospel, miracle happens,
    it serves as tool to bring more people to Jesus.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Great Outreach</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The work of evangelism committed into our hands involves great planning. We
    need to utilize appropriate methods to effectively reach the different and
    diverse fields of this work. In our Organization, the quarterly AWAKE
    (Activity Week of Accelerated Kingdom Evangelism) must be scrupulously
    utilized for targeted outreach within our communities. This can involve
    crusades, road shows, bus evangelism, market ministry, creating of house
    fellowships and even planting churches, among many others. In carrying out
    this great outreach, there is need to delineate some appropriate people to
    reach.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Frangelism.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This is evangelism targeted at the acronym that stands for Friends,
    Relatives and neighbours Evangelism. These category of people are those the
    Lord has brought to our immediate area of influence. We must start to carry
    out our outreach for them. This includes our parents, children, siblings
    etc. They need to be won for Christ so that they are not eternally doomed.
    It is a field that no Christian should ignore. Until these ones are
    genuinely converted, we must not stop to bombard heaven for their
    salvation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Unreached People Group.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We must take the gospel to areas that have never been reached before. There
    are many unreached group people in and outside our nation. We must make
    efforts to identify them and reach them. Philip took the gospel to Samaria,
    a community that was known for sorcery, and the light of the gospel broke
    through. (Acts 8:5) Let us take time to identify these communities in and
    outside our Nation and begin to pray for them. Paul took the gospel to many
    unreached groups and souls were won. (Acts 16:7-9)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Riverine Community.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to take the gospel to these communities that are often under siege
    of demonic attack and ecological disadvantages. The Lord Jesus went to the
    lake of Gennesaret, a riverine community, to preach the kingdom. This field
    must never be neglected, we must reach out to them in our evangelical plan.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>Window 10/40</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The area so designated is the home of majority of the world’s unevangelized
    countries. The unevangelized are people who have minimal knowledge of the
    gospel but have no valid opportunity to respond to it. The 10/40 window
    contains four (4) of the world dominant religious blocs where there is
    preponderance of the poor and heavily demonic spiritual stronghold (II Cor.
    4:4). We are to also target the countries in this bloc in carrying out the
    great outreach that we are to carry out.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>E. </strong>
    <strong>External Ministry.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Many people may never step into the four walls of the church to make the
    needed contact with the gospel. It is therefore necessary that believers
    would carry out the great outreach by stepping out of the church to reach
    out to some of these souls outside the church. Some of the strategies may
    involve evangelical projects that focus on prostitutes’ evangelism, Area
    Boys Ministry, Prison Ministry, School Outreach, Bible clubs, Old People’s
    Ministry, Remand Homes Ministry. It is imperative to clearly state that we
    have a great outreach to carryout and we must ask the Lord to assist us to
    achieve some mileage in the great field ahead of us as believers.

<p class="article"> 
    We have received a great commission from the Lord to evangelize the whole
    world without exception. The task is arduous from the human point of view.
    Some of the places the Lord has committed to us may even be hostile and
    perilous but the truth is that He has promised to go with us. The Lord has
    the capacity to see us through the most difficult circumstances. Also very
    importantly we have been given the commission of the Holy Spirit to
    strengthen our inadequacies. There is no more excuse, this is the time to
    roll our sleeves and go out to do the work of our master.

<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        There is no doubt that the influence of a good mother is an often
        highlighted aspect in the lives of great Bible characters. Think of
        Moses, Samuel and Jesus himself, and the importance their mothers had
        in their upbringing. The spiritual influence of a mother can never be
        underestimated. So this Mother's Day, take the opportunity to celebrate
        mothers in line with the following Bible characters. They experienced
        the same problems mothers do today.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Isaac’s Mother, Sarah – An Older Mother (Gen. 17-20). </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sarah was Abraham’s wife and mother of Isaac. Her name was originally
    “Sarai” but was changed to Sarah by God, who also changed her husband’s
    name, “Abram” to Abraham (father of many nations). She was half-sister of
    Abraham who was ten years her senior. She was about sixty-five (65) years
    old when she left Haran with Abraham (Gen. 12:5, 17:7). Despite the promise
    of God that Abraham would become the father of a chosen nation, Sarah was
    barren. At the age of seventy-five (75) she decided to offer her Egyptian
    maidservant, Hagar to her husband, by whom she could have a child. Truly,
    Hagar bore a son named Ishmael but that was not the plan of God (Gen. 16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    However, God visited her at the age of ninety (90), when she thought she
    was far beyond childbearing age, and she gave birth to a son, Isaac, the
    child of promise (Gen. 21:1-7). Isaac means laughter. Sarah, who had been
    mocked for many years as a barren woman, now had a cause to laugh. Prophet
    Isaiah declared Abraham and Sarah as the father and mother of the Hebrew
    people (Is. 51:2). Apostle Paul pointed to the faith of Abraham despite the
    deadness of Sarah’s womb (Rom. 4:19, 9:9). Apostle Peter pointed out the
    qualities of Sarah an as example of holy women who trusted God, possessed
    inward spiritual beauty, and were submissive to their husbands (1 Pet.
    3:5-6). She was listed in the book of Hebrews as one of the qualified
    heroines in the roll call of the faithful (Heb. 11:11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A mature and experienced woman. she had the testimony of being a submissive
    wife. This must have accounted for the upbringing of Isaac and the members
    of her household. God even said concerning Abraham,
    <em>
        “Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and
        all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? For I know him,
        that he will command his children and his household after him, and they
        shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the
Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.” (        <strong>Gen 18:18-19).</strong>
    </em>
    As the saying, “behind a successful man, there is a woman”. Hence, Sarah is
    obviously a co-beneficiary of this Divine commendation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        Moses’ Mother, Jochebed – A Protective Mother (Gen. 24-27).
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jochebed, the mother of Miriam, Aaron and Moses was a daughter of Levi and
    married from the same tribe of Levi to Amram. She gave birth to Moses when
    Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, made a decree that every male child born by the
    Hebrews should be killed. She initially hid him for three months to protect
    Moses from being killed. She later placed him in an ark of bulrushes on the
    (bank of Nile) river. When Pharaoh’s daughter came to bathe in the river,
    she discovered the baby. She was attracted by the cry of the baby and her
    feminine compassion was aroused. She eventually rescued the baby. By divine
    orchestration, Jochebed (Mother of Moses) became his paid nurse.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jochebed was noted among the heroines of faith (Heb. 11:23). Her name
    means, “Jehovah is honour” or “Jehovah is her glory”. God actually covered
    her with His glory and honoured her faith in keeping her son, Moses, alive.
    The courage and faith of this tender and protective mother in exhibiting
    bravery despite the dangerous consequences of Pharaoh’s edict (Exodus
    2:1-10), was alluded to in Hebrews 11:23. Her faith and courage were
    significantly rewarded by divine providence, to honour her pious example
    and precepts. The future lawgiver doubtless owed her much of that integrity
    which so eminently characterized him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>
        Hannah, Mother of Samuel – A Mother Who Battled Infertility (1 Sam. 1-2
    </strong>
    ).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Hannah was a wife of Elkanah, a Levite of the Kohathite branch of the
    priesthood (1 Sam 1:1-2:21). She was regarded as a barren woman because she
    was unable to bear children. Hannah suffered ridicule from Elkanah's second
    wife, Peninnah, who bore the priest several children. She was so depressed
    that during the feast in Shiloh, she prayed fervently to God and vowed that
    if she were to give birth to a son, she would devote him to the Lord's
    service. The Lord answered her prayers, and she gave birth to Prophet
    Samuel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Hannah means “Favour” or “Gracious”. She was faithful to her promise by
    making what must have been a heart-rending sacrifice. Hannah took Samuel to
    the house of the LORD in Shiloh after he was weaned, there to "remain
    forever" (1 Sam. 1:21). However, God rewarded her faithfulness with three
    more sons and two daughters. Hannah's beautiful thanksgiving psalm (Ps.
    2:1-10) is similar to the song of Mary when she learned she would be the
    mother of Jesus (Luke 1:46-55).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister "before
    the Lord." And each year, when the parents came up to Shiloh, Hannah
    brought him "a little coat" (which denotes priestly robe, a long upper
    tunic (Ex 28:31, 1Chron 15:27), in which to minister in the tabernacle (1
    Sam 2:19; 15:27; Job 2:12). The scripture says,
    <strong>
        <em>
            "And the child Samuel grew before the Lord." (1 Sam. 2:21, 26).
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>Mary, mother of Jesus – the most honored mother (Luke 1). </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Mary gained much popularity as the mother of Jesus (Luke 1-2). Nothing was
    known of Mary's background other than that she was a peasant and a resident
    of Nazareth, a city of Galilee. She was from the tribe of Judah and
    probably in the line of David (Luke 1:32). Although the genealogies in
    Matthew chapter 1 and Luke chapter 3 do not say so, because they trace
    Joseph's genealogy rather than Mary's. We do know also that Mary's cousin,
    Elizabeth, was the mother of John the Baptist.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The angel Gabriel appeared to her, calling her "highly favoured one" and
    "blessed...among women". Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph the
    carpenter at that time. (Luke 1:28). She was greatly surprised when the
    angel announced that she would give birth to a son who would be called the
    Messiah. After Gabriel explained how such a thing could be possible, Mary
    said,
    <strong>
        <em>"Let it be to me according to your word" (Luke 1:38).</em>
    </strong>
    That Mary "found favour with God" and was allowed to give birth to His
    child indicates she must have been of high character and full of faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, Mary
    <strong>
        <em>
            "wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger" (Luke
            2:7).
        </em>
    </strong>
    By divine providence, Mary witnessed the visits of the shepherds and the
wise men and    <strong><em>"pondered them in her heart" (Luke 2:19).</em></strong> During
    the dedication of the baby Jesus in the temple, Simeon (an old man waiting
    for the consolation of Israel) made a prophecy of a sword that would pierce
    through Mary’s soul (Luke 2:35). The birth of Jesus became a threat to
    Herod and his kingdom. So, Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt to escape Herod's
    decree to murder all male children under two years old (Matt 2:13-18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Mary was present at Jesus' first open miracle at the wedding ceremony in
    Cana of Galilee – where He turned water into wine (John 2:1-12). Mary
    seemed to be asking her Son to use His power to meet the crisis. We see
    Mary again at the foot of the cross (John 19:25-27). No mention is made of
    Joseph; he had likely been dead for some time. Mary must have held fast to
    her belief in His messiahship -even though it appeared to be ending in
    tragedy. While on the cross, Jesus gave Mary over to the care of the
    beloved disciple, John. The last mention of Mary is in the upper room in
    Jerusalem, with the one hundred and twenty (120) disciples waiting for the
    coming of the promised Holy Spirit (Acts 1:14). We do not know how or when
    Mary died. Her tomb is believed to be in the Valley of Kidron in Jerusalem,
    southeast of the Temple area.

    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The impact of mothers over their children cannot be over emphasized. Their
    role is significant in the lives of their children. As home makers and role
    models, mothers have great influence on their children, who pick a lot from
    them; hence the adage, “like mother, like daughter”. The Bible admonishes
    the proper training of children as the heritage of God. Sarah was a model
    of humility and a submissive wife. Isaac must have learned respect and
    obedience from her. Moses was raised by his mother, who happened to be his
    nurse. Moses maintained composure in pharaoh’s palace that he did not
    betray the confidence reposed on him. He grew up to understand his divine
    mission as deliverer of the Jews from the captivity in Egypt. His faith and
    vision must have been influenced by his mother. Samuel’s destiny must have
    been sharpened by this mother’s faith and devotion to the living God. Mary
    was regarded as the most honoured mother because of her faith, trust and
    confidence in God. She pondered all prophetic declarations concerning her
    and the Messiah in her heart. God gives much honour to women; He demands
    their husbands to nourish and cherish them; to handle them with care and
    understanding. He also commands children to honour their parents with the
    promise of long life if they obey.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussions</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. What influence did Sarah, Jochebed, Hannah and Mary have over their
    children?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What impact is your mother having in your life?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. Discuss the role of mothers in the lives of their children with case
    studies of people around you.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    There is need to examine and review the various roles of a mother. The role
    of mothers in the lives of their children cannot be taken lightly: from
    pregnancy to delivery hour and child birth, to nursing and parenting. It is
    an awesome responsibility. We should consider the challenges associated
    with child raising, training and nurturing during growth and developmental
    stages. It takes nine months to deliver a child, it takes a life time to
    train and raise a child. A woman combines the role of a wife, mother,
    trader, professional, daughter-in-law, home maker etc. Hence, a woman must
    be valued.

    <em>
        We believe that tithing (giving 10 percent of earnings) and offerings
        [amount determined by the individuals] are God’s instruments to carry
        on His ministry, spread the gospel, and release personal blessing
        (Malachi 3:10, 1Corinthians 16:1-2).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Giving is the act of presenting or bestowing an item on someone as a
    favour. This is done on numerous occasions and for a variety of purposes.
    For instance, Daniel 2:48 tells us that giving is a form of reward for
    faithful service and a motivation to ensure future loyalty. Esther 9:22
    also shows that giving is a form of relief for the poor, bearing in mind
    that the poor will never cease from the land (Deut. 15:11). Giving is also
    to support God’s work. This kind of free will giving often results in joy
    for the giver. Giving is scriptural- it is a command for all believers.
    Thus, by giving, we are being obedient to our God, who gives us richly all
    things to enjoy (1Thomthy 6:17). By giving, we are also demonstrating that
    all things come from God, and we are giving back what belongs to Him
    (1Chron. 29:14). What is being said, in other words, is that by giving, we
    are just returning our resources to their rightful owner- God Himself.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Abraham the Giver (Gen. 14:17, 15:1)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Abraham learnt that his nephew Lot had been captured with all his
    possessions. He therefore mobilized his three hundred and eighteen (318)
    men to rescue Lot. Upon his victorious return, the King of Sodom paid
    Abraham respect for his victory over Chedorlaomer and the kings with him.
    Melchizedek, king of Salem also brought bread and wine for the refreshment
    of Abraham and his solders. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For all encomiums showered on Abraham, so to say, Abraham gave Melchizedek
    TITHES of all the spoils of the war. This action of Abraham demonstrated a
    unique act of gratitude to the king of Salem, the Priest of God Most High.
    The import of this must not go unstressed. This is to teach us that those
    who receive kindness must also show kindness. For, it is said that
    gratitude is one of nature’s laws. Thus, Abraham’s action shows tithe as an
    offering vowed and dedicated to the Most High God, which was subsequently
    put in the hands of Melchizedek His priest. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        Tithes and Offerings in the Old Testament (Lev. 27:26-34, Deut.
        12:1-18, Mal. 3:7-12)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. <strong>Meaning</strong>: <strong>Tithe</strong> means tenth part of
    one’s income offered to God for church purpose. For instance, in the Old
    Testament, Abraham presented a tithe of war booty to the Priest-King of
    Salem, Melchizedek (Gen. 14:18-20).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Offering,</strong>
    on the other hand, has diverse meanings, some of which will be briefly
    examined here:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a) It is used in the sense of a gift, which is given by one person to
    another. (Gen. 32:13-15). The story of Cain and Abel in Gen. 4:3-5 is also
    apposite.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b) It is also used in the sense of tribute, paid to a king or an over-lord.
    (2Sam. 8:2).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c) It is equally used to designate “contributions” to God, but which were
    set apart specifically for priests (Nos. 5:9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d) It is used in the sense of “contributions”_ also referred to as “Heave
    offerings” or gifts which consisted of produce of the ground, thus
    reflecting the agricultural character of early Israel (Deut. 12:1-18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    e) It is used in the sense of a special ‘levy’ ordained by God. (Ex.
    25:3-9, Ex. 35:5-8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    f) Finally, it is also construed as a ‘tax’ -an obligatory assessment of
    every Israelite male of 20 years old and above. (Ex. 30:11-16). This is
    meant to provide financial support for the sanctuary.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Command to Give: </strong>
    Tithes<strong> </strong>and offerings were ordained and ordered to be given
    by God. This is why God designated a specific place to which the Israelites
    should bring all their offerings (Deut. 12:10-11). Their tithes, and heave
    offerings of their hands e.g. their first fruits, their vows, and free-will
    offerings, whether to be used by themselves or by the priests and Levites,
    must be brought to the place which God would choose. We are, by this, also
taught to honour the Lord with our substance (Prov. 3:9-10).    <strong></strong>

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Tithes and Offerings in the New Testament </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The command to give tithes and offerings in the Old Testament is equally
    applicable in the New Testament, as the word of God is immutable (Is.
40:8). This is why the book of 1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 16:1-2 and 2    <sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 9:1-15) are full of exhortations/admonitions on
    the issue. Every believer is enjoined to set aside fund which could be used
    for charitable purposes. Those who are rich in this world should also be
    rich in good works (1Tim. 6:17,18). To be able to do this, they are to
    appropriate part of their income set aside for every good work. But,
    whoever has this world’s goods and sees his brother in need, and shuts up
    his heart from him, the love God does not abide in him (1John 3:17).
    Brethren who labour with their hands for their livelihood are to work to
    enable them be in a position to give those in need (Eph. 4:28). This is in
    line with the words of our Lord Jesus Christ in Acts 20:35, viz “It is more
    blessed to give than to receive”. Scripture also informs us that our
    charity and benevolence should be free, that is, without compulsion, and
    cheerful. Hence, it is aptly stated that God loves a cheerful giver (II
    Cor. 9:7). This also applies to our tithes and offerings.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is said that seed time and harvest time shall never cease in the land
    (Gen. 8:22). Therefore, we should give unto the Lord God with all our
    hearts, as and when due. By so doing, we are merely returning our resources
    to their rightful owner, God Himself. This will make our heavenly Father
    glad, because it demonstrates our act of obedience and loyalty, which is
    indicative of a life that is right with Him in every way.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The disciples of Jesus Christ also knew that giving is biblical and that it
    emanates from a desire to advance the work of God’s kingdom, not the
    intention of men. Tithes and offerings are expressions of our servant-hood
    to God and His people.

    <strong>Questions and Discussion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Should our giving be determined by the need or the available resources?
    (II Cor. 8:12)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Scripture teaches that our first responsibility is to meet the needs of
    the home. (I Tim. 5:8,16) Malachi 3:8 and 10 say “
    <em>
        Bring all the tithes into my store house………. If I will not open for you
        the windows of heaven and pour out for you
    </em>
    <em>such</em>
    <em>blessing</em>
    ……”

    a way out as to which should be attended to first.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In teaching this crucial lesson, the teacher must bear in mind that giving,
    be it voluntary free-will, compulsory, proactive or reactive as well as
    tithes and offerings constitute the mainstay of the church, that is, the
    “economic back bone” of the house of God. It is also for the welfare and
    upkeep of those who serve at the altar as well as for the maintenance of
    sanctuary services. He should stress that tithe is holy to God (Levit.
    27:30). He should also admonish students that it is the duty of the
    congregation to be kind to their ministers who give instructions and set
    emulative standards and examples. He must therefore exhort that what they
    do in the service of God and to His glory rebounds to their unquantifiable
    benefits.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Therefore, this must be done with a holy joy and cheerfulness. He should
    also encourage them to serve God with unparalleled gladness, since this is
    the will of God. It must be equally stressed that what was marked “tithe”
    should not be altered, whatever the intervening and unforeseen
    circumstances.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The law - necessity for training </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Exodus 20, God delivered ten (10) basic moral laws to Moses for the
    children of Israel. The laws on the first tablet focus on human
    relationship with God. The laws on the second tablet focus on our
    relationship with each other. The fifth law, the first in the second
    tablet, declares,
    <strong>
        <em>
            "Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long
            upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.” (Ex 20:12)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Law is one of the most important biblical concepts. But its nature and
    purpose must be clearly grasped. Law reveals the character and the
    standards of God, and marks the way in which human beings can express love
    for God and for each other. Furthermore, the Law reveals something of the
    righteousness of God. Exodus 20:12 commands children to obey their father
    and mother which indicates that respect of parents leads to knowing God.
    Disobedience to parents is contravention of the commandment of God which
    leads to early death.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    To help the child to obey the laws of God, he must be properly trained by
    the parents.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he
            will not depart from it.” (Prov. 22:6)
        </em>
    </strong>
    This is a divine commandment and not a suggestion. Furthermore, the parents
    are admonished,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring
            them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” (Eph. 6:4).
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>How To Train A Child (Prov. 22:6)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word "train" is from “Hanak” meaning setting aside, narrowing, or
    hedging in. Child-training involves "narrowing" a child's conduct away from
    evil and towards godliness and starting him in the right direction. That
    is, "according to" or "in accordance with". The "way" means proper way, the
    path of wise, godly living, which is emphasized frequently in the book of
    Proverbs - basically the way of wisdom. It is from this proper behavioural
    pattern or godly lifestyle that he will not turn away from when he is old,
    that is, when he is grown (attains adulthood). Give necessary instructions,
    directions and corrections,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
            bringeth his mother to shame.” (Prov. 29:15)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It has been observed, that most children who are brought up in Christian
    homes, under the influence of godly parents who teach and live by God's
    standards, follow that training. Therefore, a great duty and responsibility
    is laid on parents and instructors of children to propagate wisdom and
    righteous living. Parents are to train up children in this age of vanity,
    to keep them from the sins and snares of it and to prepare them for what
    they are designed for. They are to keep them under discipline. Train them
    as soldiers of the Lord; having faith and confidence in God, to keep rank,
    and to observe God’s word of command. Train them up, not in the way they
    would like to go (the bias of their corrupt hearts would draw them aside),
    but in the way they should go, the way in which, if you love them, you
    would have them go (Deut. 6:7). The good impressions made upon them will
    abide with them all their days.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of Child Training </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Obedience to God’s commandment has divine promises attached to it, “…
    <strong>
        <em>
            that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is
            giving you.” (Ex 20:12).
        </em>
    </strong>
    Obedience to God’s commandments brought the children of Israel out of the
    land of bondage and their continuous obedience was to keep them safe in the
    Promised Land. If they did not conduct themselves well, their days would be
    shortened in that land, both the days of particular persons (who committed
    offence and the days of their nation (which should be removed out of it).
    Those that do their duty to their parents are most likely to have the
    comfort of that which their parents gather for them and leave to them.
    Those that support their parents shall find that God, the Father of all,
    will support them. Those who, in conscience towards God, keep this and the
    rest of God's commandments, may be sure that it shall be well with them,
    and that they shall live long on earth. This promise is expounded in
    Ephesians 6:3,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
            earth.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    Long life in that good land is promised particularly to obedient children.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Training up children in that age of vanity, keeps them from the sins and
    snares of this world. It prepares and equips them for decent living. It
    prepares them for what they are designed for and helps in achieving divine
    purpose. It initiates them into the ways of God and keeps them under
    discipline. It helps them to know God and walk in His ways (Ps. 119:9-11).
    It builds up decency, and Christian virtues that enable them live in
    harmonious relationship in the society.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The laws and commandments of God are meant to bless, benefit and profit us
    if we obey them. Our relationships would be cordial and produce peaceful
    coexistence in the society. The fifth commandment concerns the duties we
    owe to our relations; those of children to their parents specified: Honour
    thy father and thy mother, which includes, decent respect to their persons
    (Lev 19:3), giving them reverence (Heb. 12:9), and obedience to their
    lawful commands (Eph. 6:1-3). Submission to their rebukes, instructions,
    and corrections; Disposing of themselves with the advice, direction, and
    consent, of parents; Endeavouring, in everything, to be the comfort of
    their parents, and to make their old age easy for them, maintaining them if
    they stand in need of support (Matt 15:4-6).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Children are offspring born to a husband and wife in the marriage
    relationship. The Bibles says, <strong><em>“</em></strong>
    <em>
        Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, The fruit of the womb is
        a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of
        one's youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; They
        shall not be ashamed, But shall speak with their enemies in the gate.”
    </em>
    (Ps 127:3-5). Children were considered gifts from God by the Hebrews, and
    to be childless was considered a reproach (Gen 16:4; Luke 1:25). This
    emphasizes the need to properly handle children and give them sound
    training. If they are the heritage of God, they must be taught the ways,
    precepts and commandments of God. Jesus clearly expressed His love and
    respect for children (Mark 9:36-37). He used the innocence and openness of
    children to illustrate the attitude necessary for entering the KINGDOM OF
    GOD (Matt 18:2-3).<em></em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Proverbs 22:6 admonishes parents to train up a child in the way he should
    go so that when he is old, he will not depart from it. A child is to be
    initiated in the way of life from the earliest dawn of intelligence (2 Tim.
    1:5; 3:15; Deut. 6:7). Children understand more than they can express. They
    should be seen as a temple newly built, and not yet profaned, should be
    solemnly set apart to the Lord, so a child, by pious training, is dedicated
    as a temple of the Holy Spirit (as Hannah's dedication of Samuel, 1 Sam
    1:28). The seed sown in childhood may seem lost for a time, but if it has
    been sown in faith, it will develop itself "when he is old." Although,
    Timothy was taught in Scripture as a child, he was not fully converted
    until he was a man (1 Tim 1:2). The seed is to be sown in childhood though
    the harvest may not be expected until adulthood.

        Pentecost is one of the prominent feasts in the Christian liturgical
        year commemorating the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples of
        Christ after the Resurrection. The feast is also called Whitsunday
        especially in the United Kingdom. Pentecost is celebrated seven weeks

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Old Testament Concept (Feast of Harvest/ Weeks) </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Feasts and Festivals were regular assemblies of the people of Israel for
    the worship of the Lord. They were scheduled at specific times in the
    annual calendar and they were both civil and religious in nature. Some
    marked the beginning or the end of the agricultural year, while others
    commemorated historic events in the life of the nation. All of the feasts
    were marked by thanksgiving and joyous feasting.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Feast of Weeks, also called the Feast of Harvest or Pentecost, was observed
    by the Jews early in the third month on the 50th day after the offering of
    the barley sheaf at the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover). It included a
    holy convocation. Leviticus 23:15-17 says,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “And you shall count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath,
            from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering: seven
            Sabbaths shall be completed. Count fifty days to the day after the
            seventh Sabbath; then you shall offer a new grain offering to the
            Lord.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    Numbers 28:26-31. It prescribes the number and nature of the offering
    during the festival while Deuteronomy 16:9-12 describes those who were to
    be invited to this feast.

<p class="article"> 
    After the death, burial, resurrection and post-resurrection appearances of
    Jesus, the disciples were gathered in an upper room because of the fear of
    the Jews, expecting the promised Holy Spirit. On the day of Pentecost,
    while the Jews were observing the Feast of Weeks, the Holy Spirit came upon
    them as a rushing mighty wind (Acts 2:1-2).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Pentecost was a harvest festival when the first fruits of the grain harvest
    were presented to God (Lev. 23:17). However, on this particular day, about
    one hundred and twenty (120) disciples of Jesus gathered in one accord in
    the upper room,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
            wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And
            there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat
            upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost,
            and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
            utterance.” (Acts 2:2-4)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This event marked the beginning of the church - fulfilling the words of
    Jesus. (Acts 1:8, Matt. 16:18-19). The church constituted the body of
    Christ by means of the Spirit’s baptism (1Cor 12:13). A day set aside for
    the presentation of the first fruit of crops, turned to a day of harvest of
    souls (first fruit of the Spirit),
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
            same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”
            (Acts 2:41)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>The Day of Pentecost: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. There was occurrence of divine influence. The presence of the third
    person in Godhead, the Holy Spirit became manifest. The disciples spoke in
    other tongues and there was repentance and salvation of souls (Acts 2).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. There was confirmation of divine mission. The disciples were endued with
    power from God as promised by Jesus (Acts 1:8). They received power,
    unction and boldness to witness Christ. The first message resulted in three
    thousand converts.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. There was endowment of power to overcome opposition. The disciple that
    locked up themselves because of fear now became bold to preach the Gospel.
    The presence of the Holy Spirit announced and exposed them.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. The supremacy of Christ and the Gospel was exhibited. The message of
    Peter brought conviction upon the Jews,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
            said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,
            what shall we do?” (Acts 2:37)
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong><em>5. </em></strong>
    The gift of diverse tongues followed the baptism of the Holy Spirit. People
    from different nations heard them,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
            were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
            language.” (Acts 2:6)
        </em>
    </strong>
    Speaking in tongues is a mystery,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “…, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of
            God. Acts 2:11

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The day of Pentecost was an annual feast that followed the Feast of
    First-fruits (i.e., seven weeks, or 49 days) and therefore, was called the
    Feast of Weeks (Lev 23:15-22). The name "Pentecost" (of Greek derivation),
    means 50 because it was the 50th day after the First-fruits Feast (Lev
    23:16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For God to choose the Day of Pentecost in sending the Holy Spirit to
    inaugurate the Church must have been very significant. We may wonder why
    the gift of the Spirit delayed until the day of Pentecost was fully come?
    No man must irreverently pry into the purposes of Deity, it proves the
    supremacy of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Pentecost was the feast of first-fruits; symbolically, the first-fruits of
    the Christian church (Lev 23:15,17; Deut. 16:9). The first sheaf of the
    Christian harvest, the first fruit of the Christian reaping souls into
    God’s kingdom. Our commission is to harvest souls (Matt. 28:18-20).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Conviction of sin is the prominent idea of the apostolic Pentecost. Peter's
    sermon resulted in the cry, "Brethren, what shall we do?" Conviction of sin
    is the prelude to a reformed life.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The first gift of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost -- the day which,
    in Jewish thought, was specially consecrated to the giving of the law from
    Sinai -- was specially fitted to the mission of convicting the world in
    respect of sin (John 16:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The first-fruits on the day of Pentecost are typical of the ingathering of
    all nations to Christ. More foreign Jews attended the Pentecost than any
    other Jewish feast. In the light of this we are to take the Gospel round
    the globe.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Jews observed diverse Feasts &amp; Festivals. — There were daily (Lev
    23), weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals, and great stress was laid on
    the regular observance of them in every particular pattern (Num. 28:1-8; Ex
    29:38-42; Lev 6:8-23; Ex 30:7-9; 27:20). On each of these occasions, every
    male Israelite was commanded "to appear before the Lord" (Deut. 27:7; Neh.
    8:9-12). The attendance of women was voluntary (Luke 2:41; 1 Sam 1:7;
    2:19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These festivals, besides their religious purposes, had an important bearing
    on the maintenance among the people of the feeling of a national unity. The
    times fixed for their observance were arranged so as to interfere as little
    as possible with the industry of the people. The Passover was kept just
    before the harvest commenced, Pentecost at the conclusion of the corn
    harvest and, the feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground
    had been gathered in.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    On this significant day of Pentecost, God chooses to baptize His People
    with the Holy Spirit. We should also note that the filling with the Holy
    Spirit is separate from the baptism of the Spirit. The Spirit's baptism
    occurs once for each believer at the moment of salvation (John 11:15-16,
    Rom 6:3; 1 Cor 12:13; Col 2:12), but the Spirit's filling may occur not
    only at salvation but also on a number of occasions after salvation (Acts
    4:8,31; 6:3,5; 7:55; 9:17; 13:9,52). An evidence of the baptism of the Holy
    Spirit was speaking in other tongues/languages (Acts 11:15-16).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        Jesus Christ created us. He bought us with His precious blood. And God
        anointed Him as our Lord. Therefore, our whole life, our personality,
        influence, material substance, our achievement and everything belongs
        to Him. We should therefore acknowledge Him as the absolute owner of
        all we are and have.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the giver of all things, and as such nobody can out-give Him.
    Whatsoever we give is just a token-very infinitesimal-out of the abundance
    He has given us, no matter how large the sum of money- be it in dollars,
    pound sterling, gold or silver or diamond and no matter how huge the
    quantity of materials. By giving, we are merely being appreciative of His
    bountiful and unquantifiable generosity, proving that we are not
    ungrateful. For of His own, we are giving (I Chron. 29:14).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The True Test Of Giving (Matt. 25:14-30)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The true test of giving is illustrated by the parable of the talents, given
    to three servants by their Master, shortly before departing on a journey.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Meaning or importance of the parable </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    First, the parable implies a state of business or work as well as a state
    of expectancy.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Second, the Master here is our Lord Jesus Christ, “the absolute owner and
    proprietor of all persons and things.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Third, the servant here implies Christians, employed in the Master’s
    (Christ’s) work.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Fourth, the Master committed some trust to the servants having employed
    them to work for Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Fifth, the servants received the talents from their Master, which implies a
    readiness to work for Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sixth, the talents were given to each servant in proportion to the overall
    ability of each servant.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>
        Rendering Account of Stewardship- “Different Performance Levels”:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Two of the Servants Did Well: </strong>
    Upon His return, the Master demanded accountability from His servants.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Reading through these verses, it is manifestly clear that two of the
    servants did well. They were diligent and faithful. They went and traded
    with the money, thus putting the money into intended use and made returns
    on it.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>The Third Servant: </strong>
    The third servant was unfaithful and indolent, as well as unenterprising.
    Rather than trade with what he had, he dug the earth and hid the lone
    talent given him, for fear of being stolen. He was full of untenable
    excuses for his crass laziness. This is equally applicable to spiritual
    gifts. Many have them, but don’t make use of them for the purpose for which
    they are given.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    C. <strong>Rewards Meted Out To the Three Servants:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The first two servants who traded and made profits with their talents were
    commended and rewarded for their diligence and integrity. Thus, if we do
    that which is good, and do it well, we shall be praised.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The third servant’s account was found to be bad. The lesson for us here is
    that the smallness of our receiving will not excuse us from reckoning. His
    excuses and apologies did not stand him in good stead. So it is with those
    of us who despise little beginnings and small opportunities (Zech. 4:10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        Why Should Christians Give? (2Corin. 8:1-15, 9:6-8, 10-20, Matt.
        6;19-21)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>Divine Instruction to Give: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A Christian is obliged to give, because
    <em>
        “true Christianity is subject to the gospel, yielding ourselves to the
        commanding influence of its truths and law.”
    </em>
    Hence, a true Christian is expected to demonstrate the sincerity of his
    subjection to the gospel by works of charity (Deut. 5:11; Matt. 26:11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>Encouragement to Give:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In our reference text for this topic, Apostle Paul used several cogent
    arguments to stir up the Corinthians to the ministry of giving.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Corinthians were commended for their faith and diligence and love for
    their ministers. In his commendation, Paul urged them to crave the grace to
    abound in giving to the poor (II Cor. 8:10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Manner of Acceptable Giving (II Cor. 9:6-8)</strong>
    :
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For our giving to be acceptable, Apostle Paul admonished that such giving
    must be as commanded. That is, our giving should be bountiful. It should be
    given deliberately, as consciously proposed in the heart of the giver. It
    should not be given hastily, not with compulsion..
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are also enjoined to give freely, and not grudgingly, but cheerfully, as
    God loves a cheerful giver (II Cor. 9:7). The giving should also be liberal
    with an open hand and open mind and with an open countenance to demonstrate
gladness for the ability and opportunity to be charitable.    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Benefits of Giving</strong>
    :
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Paul noted that givers would not be losers by what they give. He stated
    further that what is given to the poor in a right manner-freely and
    liberally- is far from being lost, as the giver will reap it with increase,
    with good returns.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Acceptable giving is far from impoverishing the giver, rather, it is a
    veritable means of godly enrichment-truly rich indeed. Therefore, true
    Christians should not be weary of giving, as giving will rebound to the
    praise and glory of God (Phil. 4:19; Ps. 112:9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>What Should Christians Give?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We should give the following among others.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Treasures; Tithes and Offerings: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These are the three areas specifically identified for Christians to give.
    These areas have been extensively treated in lesson 21 where it was pointed
    out that Abraham set the ball rolling by giving ten percent of all the
    spoils of the war.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Time and Talent: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In addition to treasures, tithes and offerings, Christians are also to give
    their precious time and their inalienable talents. In giving our time for
    God’s work. We must bear in mind that time is an invaluable resource at the
    disposal of all and sundry, equally and without discrimination. None has
    monopoly of it, because God is Lord over time. He created and ordained it
    (Gen. 1:4,5,14-19). Therefore, it is incumbent on all Christians to be
    conscious of the fact that some times are divinely appointed, especially in
    carrying out God’s will for a specific mission or assignment at a specific
    time (Acts 17:26). <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Talent, on the other hand, is any natural or special gift, or special
    aptitude, according to a dictionary definition. It is God-given, and as
    such, should be used to serve God as a pay-back. Thus, Christians need to
    consciously identify their respective talents, such as singing, dancing,
    drumming, acting, teaching etc., which they can give to God by way of
    joining the respective arms in their churches <em></em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Pleasing God is to be the first purpose of our life. Therefore, our
    faithful giving, as well as our full tithes and generous offerings should
    be uppermost in our mind as a veritable avenue to please God. This was
    exemplified by the two servants, who faithfully traded with the talents
    given them by their Master-and made profits when He was away. The third
    servant, who buried his lone talent in the ground, had nothing to show for
    it. Thus, while the other two pleased their Master and won accolades for
    their faithfulness and diligence, the third lazy one incurred the
    displeasure and wrath of his Master. What he had was even taken away from
    him and given to his industrious colleagues. This brings about the dictum
    “use it or lose it”. To win the reward of giving, we should be honest with
    it, and give as and when due, with open minds. Our giving is not confined
    to our treasures, tithes and offerings, but is inclusive of our invaluable
    time and our unique abilities and capabilities. We should, therefore, try
    to have the same estimate/evaluation of such to enable us put them to good
    use.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Why should a Christian give and what should be the components of the
    giving?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2a. When it comes to giving, some Christians murmur and grumble about
    “donor fatigue”. What could be the basis for this?
</p>

    2b. What are the characteristics of acceptable and unacceptable giving?

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Teaching the Lesson (Teachers Site)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Christian life is a purpose driven life, with serving and giving as its
    twin neighbours. Whenever we give, we are actually serving God. We are
    blessed to be a blessing to others around us. We are to strive to put to
    best use our God-given abilities, i.e. talents, Our motto for this purpose-
    driven life should be:
    <em>
        “Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you
        can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the
        people you can, as long as you ever can”
    </em>
    (Source: Rick Warren: Purpose Driven Life, 2002, page 259).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is therefore apposite that our students should be asked to pray against
    the triad of spiritual selfishness, spiritual miserliness and spiritual
    insensitivity to the myriad of needs around them, which relentlessly war
    against spiritual bountiful giving. To enable them key in to this prayer
    point, their attention should be drawn to 1Tim. 6:7 and Ps. 49:17 viz “
    <em>
        For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
        nothing out.”
    </em>
    This is further reinforced with the fact that nobody knows who would
    inherit the accumulated wealth and property, after we quit this earthly
    habitation when our tenancy of it expires (Eccl. 2:19-19). For who can tell
    a man what will happen to him after under the sun? (Eccl. 6:12) In
peroration, our giving should be anchored on the diction    <strong>“<em>God deserves our best”</em></strong>

    <em>
        Professor, J.I. Parker (a British-born Canadian Christian theologian)
        said that fathers need to understand how much they lack the knowledge
        of God. They must learn to measure themselves, not by their knowledge
        about God, not by how many verses they can spit out by memory, not by
        their gifts or talents or ministry, but by how they pray, by how they
        commune with the Lord in His Word, by what goes on in their hearts, and
        by their level of obedience to what they know. These will help fathers
        to see their responsibilities as God sees them. Though enormous, but
        God’s grace will make them succeed if they try.<strong></strong>

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Father </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A father is a male parent. In Bible times, a father was the male parent of
    a household, charged with the responsibility of providing for the family
    and giving religious instructions to the children. The social structure
    described in the Old Testament is known as a "patriarchal" society. The
    word patriarchy means "the rule of the father." The father commanded a high
    position in the family; his word was law. The Hebrew word translated into
    English as husband actually means "lord," "master," "owner," or "possessor"
    (Gen 18:12; Hos. 2:16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Role of The Father </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As the head of the family, the father was expected to assume certain
    responsibilities. These responsibilities can be classified into three
    categories: spiritual, social, and economic.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Spiritual Responsibility </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    He was responsible for the spiritual well-being of the family, as well as
    the individual members of the family. Furthermore, the father functioned as
    the priest of his family, sacrificing on their behalf (Gen 12:8; Job 1:5).
    Later, when a priesthood was established in Israel and the layman no longer
    functioned at an altar, the father's spiritual role was redefined. He
    continued to be the religious leader in the home. This involved the
    training of the children in godliness (Ex 12:3,26-27; Prov 22:6; Eph 6:4).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Social Responsibility </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The father was responsible for the protection of his family. He was to see
    that no one took advantage of any member of his family. Those who were not
    protected by a father were truly disadvantaged persons. The two most common
    categories of "fatherless" people were widows and orphans. The father’s
    specific responsibilities according to Jewish tradition were; to have his
    son circumcised; to pass on his inheritance to his firstborn son; to find
    his son a wife; and to teach him a trade. A father is responsible for the
    social well-being of his family.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Economic Responsibility </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The father was to provide for the needs of the various members of his
    family. A lazy man who failed to provide for his family would be mocked,
    shaming him to do what was expected of him (Prov. 6:6-11). Even in the New
    Testament context, apostle Paul rebuked those who considered themselves
    Christian but who did not look after the needs of their families (1 Tim.
    5:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We need to fully understand and appreciate the concept of having God as the
    believer's Father. He knows all about us, even numbering the hairs on our
    head (Matt 10:30). He protects His child and rescues him when he gets into
    trouble (Isa 63:15-16). He teaches him the way that he should go (Hos.
    11:1-3) and supplies all of his needs (Matt 6:33). In turn, the Father
    expects honour from His children, although He does not always receive it
    (Mal 1:6).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The father has been charged with awesome responsibility of providing,
    protecting and instructing members of his household. He is the priest of
    the house, dictating the spiritual tone, development, service and worship
    of his family. As the breadwinner, he is to provide the needs of his
    household. Apostle Paul views this with seriousness,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for
            those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than
            an unbeliever.” (1 Tim 5:8)
        </em>
    </strong>
    He has the responsibility to see to the smooth running of his family. He
    must teach, instruct, guide and monitor the progress and well-being of
    every member of his family.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Considering the fatherly role of God to believers, we need to re-examine
    our own role as fathers today. We need to be alive to our responsibilities
    to the family. A father should know all about his children, by creating
    time for them, relating and communicating with them. He should understand
    their state, problems, needs and challenges. God knows even the numbers of
    the hairs on our head (Matt 10:30). A father should be the defender of
    members of his household. God protects His children and rescues them when
    they get into trouble (Isa 63:15-16). A father should teach his family the
    way they should go (Prov. 22:6) as the priest in the house and also provide
    for their needs.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A father has great duty and responsibilities to his wife, children and
    other members of his household including relatives. He should be a role
    model and worthy example to the members of his family and society in
    general; a real man that is honoured in the society.
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the
            womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the
            children of one's youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full
            of them; they shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with their
            enemies in the gate.” (Ps 127:3-5).
        </em>
    </strong>
    Fathers are enjoined to train their children and pass down the divine
    ordinances to their children’s children.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Book of Deuteronomy chapter 6 emphasizes the importance of obedience to
    God’s commandment,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “that you may fear the Lord your God, to keep all His statutes and
            His commandments which I command you, you and your son and your
            grandson, all the days of your life, and that your days may be
            prolonged. Therefore hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe it,
            that it may be well with you, and that you may multiply greatly as
            the Lord God of your fathers has promised you — 'a land flowing
            with milk and honey.' (Deut 6:2-3).
        </em>
    </strong>
    From verse 10, God warned them seriously against the consequences of
    disobedience,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the
            Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
            possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to
            cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath
            spoken.” (Deut. 6:18-19).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        We believe that Christians should avoid excesses and that their
        moderation should be obvious to others. Their commitment to Christ
        should be deep and sincere, but they should not indulge in or lead
        other people into extremes or fanaticism. Christians should be well
        thought of, balanced, humble and self-sacrificing, reflecting Christ’s
        grace and character in all areas of their lives (Colossians 3:12-13,
        Philippians 4:5).
    </em>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Generally, life is made up of people with different attitudes. On one end,
    we have people who are carefree while on the other extreme, we have those
    who do things in excess. God did His work of creation in six days but
    rested on the seventh day. He gave the same directive to the Israelites. In
    other words, while God abhors laziness, He also detests the workaholics.
    Therefore, in our attitude to life and other life engagements, we are
    expected to apply moderation. It should be noted here that moderation
    should not be seen only in relation to our dressing, but reflected in the
    totality of life in Christ. Moderation could be defined as not being
    excessive, or avoidance of extremes.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Moderation of our Attitude to Life: </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Godly attitudes are to be guided under moderation. Jesus wants us to avoid
    being lukewarm believers. Yet, he does not want us to become fanatics who
    are reckless and unreasonable. The old King James Version of Phil 4:5 says
    “Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand”. Although
    the word “moderation” here could also be translated as "gentleness”, the
    fact is clear that we must keep our attitude in check as Jesus Himself was
    “gentle and meek” to avoid embarrassing Him. Our attitude must always be
    befitting unto the Lord in line with life of the Antioch Christians (Act
    11:26). To be good ambassadors of Christ, we must always display attitudes
    of decency and orderliness (1 Cor. 14:40).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Moderation in Physical Outlook</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our physical outlook is very important to God. So, it must be moderated
    appropriately. It is true that we don’t recommend dressing code, yet, a
    Spirit filled believer should understand the difference between worldly and
    godly outlooks. This includes the shape of our hair, eyelids, lips, nails
    and dresses. The bible says, “Everything is permissible but not everything
    is beneficial. Everything is permissible but not everything is
    constructive” (1 Cor. 10:23). Apart from specific biblical instructions,
    believers must also seek the socio-cultural dictates of their environment
    or community to moderate their conduct. No wonder, the above verse ended
    with the warning that “nobody should seek his own good, but the good of
    others.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Moderation of Our Actions:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Believers are to moderate their actions, consciously and otherwise. It is
    basically instructive that as believers, we must act moderately so as not
    to “cause anyone to stumble” (1 Cor. 10:32). We are encouraged to seek
    financial breakthrough, but we must avoid love of money which is the root
    of all evils (1 Tim. 6:10). We are to be angry but not sin (Eph. 4:26).
    Also, we are to be quick to listen but slow to speak and slow to become
    angry (James 1:19). While we are to eat well, we must moderate our appetite
    to avoid gluttony (Prov. 23:2; 28:7 and Titus 1:2). No matter how much we
    respect our leaders, we must moderate our reverence for them so that they
    don't become another idol competing with God in our lives or causing
    disunity (1 Cor. 3:3-7). Indeed, when we are in the Spirit and prophesying
    in the fellowship, our actions must be guided by moderation because “the
    spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets” and ”God is not
    a God of disorder but of peace as in all the congregations of the saints”
    (1 Cor. 14:33-34).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Moderation must be the guiding principle of any believer who wishes to
    please the Lord. It should not only be observed in dressing but in our
    general life engagements.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Life Application</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to speak but must not become talkative. We are to eat but not become
    gluttons. We are to sleep but must not become another Eutychus (Act
    20:9-10). We must discipline our children but always in moderation. We are
    to fast but be mindful of our health and age. We are to relate with the
    opposite sex but moderated by godliness and righteousness. Every believer
    must ensure moderation in their offices and avoid turning official hours to
    prayer sessions and evangelism programmes. It must include the level of our
    involvements in cultural organizations, our speed limits when driving and
    level of accumulation of financial and material possessions here on earth
    at the detriment of our eternity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. How can moderation be reflected in our prayer life?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Prayers should be done as led by the spirit of God. However, when our noise
    is disturbing our roommates or co-tenants, we have to moderate our voice
    and sound. Also, when our church is causing noise pollution in the
    community, it should be moderated.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Is there any moderation in love?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Yes, our love for people must not compete with that of God to avoid turning
    them to idols

<p class="article"> 
    Moderation must be a guiding principle for Christians in all ramifications.
    The teacher should guide the students to understand that moderation is not
    just about dressing but about all areas of our existence. It should be
    observed in the way we talk in and outside the church. It should reflect in
    the way we pursue our goals and life ambitions. Our physical outlook and
    social carriage are not excluded. A practical discussion on seemingly
    unnoticed areas like driving culture, eating habits, social engagements,
    social media practice, fellowship involvements of students on campuses etc.
    should be initiated by the teacher.
