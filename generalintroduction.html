        Biblical Truths: It's What the Foursquare Church Believes In<em>.</em>
    </strong>
    
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Dearly Beloved of the Lord! On behalf of the leadership of our great
    movement, I welcome you to the New Year, 2017. Our focus this year, shall
    be the studies of our doctrinal tenets, and it is believed that everyone
    will endeavour to be active part of our Sunday school studies as we do this
    only once in five years. Other seasonal lessons are also inside this manual
    as they are relevant.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation
    of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has
    God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture
    of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is totally true and
    trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and
    therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of
    Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct,
    creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a
    testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    On this truth I present to you for the next 12 months what our movement
    believes which is firmly standing upon the truth of the Bible as I
    explained above. The Foursquare Church believes that Jesus Christ is the
    Saviour, Baptizer with the Holy Spirit, Healer, and Soon-Coming King. We
    stand firm on the foundation set by Hebrews 13:8, which proclaims: "Jesus
    Christ the same, Yesterday and Today and Forever."
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Beloved, study to show yourself approved unto God and to your students.
    Pray, plan, prepare and present your lessons well that your students will
    always look forward to your class every Sunday. God will reward you
    greatly. Remain blessed and be attractive with the Gospel of Christ.

<h3>Our Legacy of Foursquare Doctrine</h3>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    One of the distinguishing qualities for which our Foursquare Movement is
    renown and respected world-wide is its scripturally- balanced, solid and
    sound doctrines based on the unerring Word of God. This is the reason why
    since its inception in 1923, the Movement has not only waxed great, but is
    also spreading like wild fire throughout the globe.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The founder of the Movement, Aimee Semple McPherson said,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is the most
            beautiful Gospel in the world.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    It presents Jesus Christ as the four Gospels writers did. The Gospel of
    Luke presents Jesus as the Saviour of the world, while Apostle John, the
    beloved in his own gospel presents Jesus Christ as the Baptizer with the
    Holy Spirit. On the other hand, Mark presents Jesus as the Great
    never-failing Physician and Matthew presents Jesus Christ as the soon
    coming King.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    I am very much privileged to have come across the most beautiful Gospel in
    the universe since 1958 and after two years became a member and a
    front-line worker of the<strong><em> </em></strong>about a half billion
    adherents of the Movement.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our 22 tenets of faith are treated in detail to give no room for
    gainsayers. The Holy Scriptures are meticulously presented that there is
    hardly any reasonable piece of information one desires to know about the
    Holy Bible that our declaration of faith does not furnish. Similarly, the
    Eternal Godhead, our second tenet of faith was beautifully and clearly
    treated including the most disputable topic of Trinity. The universally
    accepted Athanasian Creed which is self-explicit and still stands
    unparalleled till the present time was quoted to make the topic very clear
    to any unbiased mind.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Fall of Man and Plan of Redemption are treated as clearly depicted by
    the Holy Scriptures to give no man to boast of his redemption but rather to
    thank God. The New Birth and Daily Christian Living are treated in such
    graciousness that every believer should thank Jesus Christ for His precious
    blood shed on the cross for the eternal life we enjoy by His painful death.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Baptism and the Lord’s Supper as well as The Baptism of the Holy Spirit
    are treated with constant reminiscence of the price Jesus paid for every
    redeemed soul. The Spirit –filled Life and The Gifts and Fruits of the
    Spirit, Moderation and Divine Healing are treated in our declaration of
    Faith to make every recipient of these virtues a debtor to Christ be
    grateful to Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Second Coming of Christ and Church Relationship are so elaborately
    treated that every believer should not only keep watching but also working
    relentlessly for the imminent return of the glorified Jesus, making good
    use of the grace, gifts and talents bestowed on him or her by the Master
    and fulfilling their obligations to the Church of Christ on earth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Final Judgment speaks for itself. That the certainty of God’s judgment
    is inevitable; while the believers will appear before the judgment seat of
    Christ only to receive their rewards, Satan, his horde and the unsaved as
    well as Death and Hades will be judged and cast into the lake of fire. This
    is clearly treated in our declaration of faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Heaven and Hell are often spoken of on earth. There is no right-thinking
    person who does not believe in the two places except the atheists who deny
    the existence of God. To live soberly and righteously to gain Heaven and
    shun Hell is well treated in our tenets of Faith as well.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Spirit of Evangelism, the 21<sup>st</sup> tenet of our faith is given
    an appropriate treatment in our declaration of faith. That we should
    “gospelize” the good news not only by our lips but also by our lives which,
    through the power of the Holy Spirit, draws souls to the exalted Christ is
    equally emphasized in our declaration of faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Tithes and Offerings, though the last but not the least of our tenets is
    well treated to enable the Church of Christ on earth carry out the last
    command of the risen Christ to His Church on earth. “
    <strong>
        <em>
            The last command of the risen Jesus Christ to His disciples is our
            first mandate on earth.”
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This inspiring and heart-motivating inscription was conspicuously displayed
    on the Church building of one of our Churches in Oregon State- ‘To run with
    the command of the risen Lord, making Christ known and accepted as the only
    Messiah of the world calls for tithes and offerings of His children. These
    obligations are well taught in our declaration of faith.’
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Dear brethren, it is a privilege and life span opportunity for you not only
    to be a member of the Foursquare Movement but also to sit at the feet of
    Jesus in our millions of Sunday School classes to study the Word so as to
    be workers who need not to be ashamed of spreading the gospel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God bless you all in Jesus’ miracle-working name.
