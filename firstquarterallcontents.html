<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        We come to the new year of 2017. On behalf of the Leadership, I welcome
        you and your loved ones into this brand new year. Most people generally
        look at the New Year as a fresh start, as an opportunity to overcome a
        habit, or do better on something they count worthwhile and which needs
        to be improved upon. It may be serving as a parent, being a better
        marriage partner, building or buying a house. It may be developing
        different priorities, using and managing our time better, or whatever
        things that people would like to change. So, people all over the world
        talk about New Year's resolutions; resolutions which are usually broken
        in a matter of weeks. Many people are very pessimistic about the whole
        issue of making resolutions, and they may be right because many
        resolutions that have so many good intentions are followed by failures.
        They crash-land within the first quarter of the year.
    </em>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        Regardless of such failures, the New Year is a time to reflect and
        think about what the past year has brought and what the New Year could
        bring. It is a time to stop and analyze, to take stock of our
        priorities, values, pursuits, and goals. As Christians, it is a time to
seriously think about our stewardship of        <strong>time, talents and treasures</strong>. This is very important
        because God has so much planned our lives and our stewardship to
        revolve around and through the life of His Son, Jesus Christ. On this
        note, I implore you to take this year seriously as we all know that
        from every indication, our redemption draws nearer than we think. The
        responses of those concerned in our lesson of today matter to us in
        making resolutions.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Response of The Heavenly Host (2:13-14)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The fact and time of the response:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Immediately after the announcement in verses 11-12, there was a heavenly
    response by a host of angels. This certainly sets an example for us humans
    for whom Christ was born. Christmas and all of life should be a time of
    thankful praise to God for the person and work of Jesus Christ if one truly
    understands the significance of His life and death to both God and man
    (Eph. 3:10; I Tim. 3:16; I Pet. 1:12).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The nature of the response:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The response was an act of praise and adoration to God manifesting at least
    three things:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. It recognized God as the source or origin of the birth of Christ, the
    supreme gift of God, which manifested God's glory.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. It revealed the key outcome to mankind, which is peace to men as
    follows:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a) Peace with God (reconciliation from enmity to harmony).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b) The peace of God (of fellowship and provision).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c) The peace of harmony and unity with one another.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d) Universal peace through the reign of Christ on earth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. It revealed the recipients of this peace; those who know His Son by
    faith and walk in fellowship with Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        Response and Actions of The Shepherds, Mary And Others (2:15-20)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Circumstances and Time of the Response:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Revelation from God always demands an adequate response in man. This means
    we become even more accountable before God according to the revelation we
    have.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This news and information became the center of the Shepherds’ conversation.
    Likewise, the Sunday morning message, for instance, could become a topic
    for the family on their ride home or at the dinner table.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Character of Their Response (2:15b-16)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 1. </strong>
    <strong>They Spoke Excitedly</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It means they began and continued to speak with one another as men who were
    excited about what they had heard.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 2. </strong>
    <strong>They Spoke Reciprocally</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This demonstrates how we are social beings and how we need to give and
    receive input from one another. Two principles are involved here:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    No man is an island, we need others and others need us.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We need to share Jesus Christ and talk of Him with one another.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 3. </strong>
    <strong>They Spoke Encouragingly</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This gives us a good example of how in this setting we need the
    exhortation, comfort, encouragement, challenge, and sometimes loving rebuke
    of others. We need it from others and they need it from us.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 4. </strong>
    <strong>They Acted Purposefully</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Without biblical goals based on biblical values, people never go straight.
    As we face this New Year, with our compass in hand (our Bibles), let's
    examine our lives. Where have we been and where are we going? What kind of
    goals do we have and should we have? Let us chart our course and set some
    new goals based on the values and priorities of the Word of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 5. </strong>
    <strong>They Acted Immediately</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    They were determined, undeviating, and non-procrastinating. As a result of
    this action, the shepherds found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the
    baby. And as a result, their lives would never be the same.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 6. </strong>
    <strong>They Acted Insightfully</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    They not only saw Him with their eyes, but they went away with spiritual
    insight having seen the Lord, who was announced to them by the angels. What
    can we learn from their example?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>First,</strong>
    we each need the same kind of interest and hunger for spiritual things that
    led these men to go and search for Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Second,</strong>
    God rewarded their efforts to go and see the Christ Child. And so He does
    with us.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Third,</strong>
    knowing Jesus Christ, seeing and understanding spiritual truth, gives
    insight for living. It renews our minds and enables us to re-evaluate our
    lives, our reasons for living, our values, goals, priorities, and the whole
    works.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 7. </strong>
    <strong>They Acted Evangelistically</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Here is the most important information in the world that needs to be told
    and shared. When something good happens to us, we generally can't wait to
    tell others.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 8. </strong>
    <strong>Mary Acted Reflectively</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word "pondered" indicates a continuous action. Pondering the things of
    Christ must become our practice, a constant part of our lives.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In this, Mary gives us an example of the principle of meditating on the
    things of God that we have read, studied, heard, and memorized for better
    understanding and application. Why do we learn the Word? So that we might
    reflect on it for greater understanding and application.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Let me say here that biblical meditation is gradually becoming a lost art.
    People rarely take time for meditating on God's Word. They simply do not
    have the right perspective and time for it. We seem to think only from the
    mind-set of activity and business.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> 9. </strong>
    <strong>They Acted Worshipfully</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These men returned with a song in their hearts and praise on their lips.
    Their lives would now be filled with a new dimension of worship and
    dramatically transformed life. These shepherds were common men living very
    common and ordinary lives.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Let's not fail to note that they went back to their sheep, to their
    occupation, and undoubtedly also to their families; but they went back
    changed men.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As we face this New Year; how are we going to respond to the messages of
    Scripture? What difference is it going to make in our lives? Remember that
    it takes two to make a good message (the bearer and the hearer) that
    reaches our hearts and has an effect on our lives.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Every January, millions of people begin their year with New Year’s
    resolutions on different things; but what about making spiritual New Year’s
    resolutions?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We make commitments and tell our friends and families on January 1st, only
    to give it all up by January 3rd. But as humans, our struggle for
    consistency goes way beyond resolutions. Making commitments we can’t keep
    runs all through society, back to Biblical times. Life is not always easy.
    Following through on simple commitments can even be difficult when
    bombarded by every day affairs. In addition, the attacks of the evil one
    will challenge us at every turn.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the Bible, James spoke of some people who can teach us a valuable lesson
    about great intentions that aren’t aligned with God’s will (Jam.4:13-17).

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The preceding verses, 2:1-12, give us the account of the birth of the
    Saviour with the revelation of His birth to the shepherds by an angel of
    the Lord. Our study passage of Luke 2:13-20 gives us a tremendous precedent
    for the New Year and the kind of issues we might consider. We would like to
    focus our attention on what followed the announcement to the shepherds
    (vss. 13-20). In these verses, we see both heaven and earth responding to
    the news of the birth of Jesus Christ in such a way that it exhorts and
    challenges us in our lives: in our attitudes, priorities, values, pursuits,
    and actions as it pertains to worship. It also challenges us as to our
    behaviour towards spiritual things and even, our reasons for living.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The response by the shepherds as seen in this passage sets a precedent on
    how we should respond in view of the person and work of the Lord Jesus. The
    response and actions of the angels and the shepherds to the news of the
    birth of Christ provide some tremendous lessons and examples for us. Let us
    note that first, it was not the angels that excited the shepherds, but the
    news, which they viewed in faith as from God. Second, Scripture teaches us
    that it is not miraculous experiences that change men, it's the Word and
    the Spirit of God (Luke 16:27-31). The response of the shepherds was the
    result of the proclamation of truth (Scripture). This gives a good analogy
    for us to hear the Word on a regular basis, and to act on what we learn and
    know.

    <strong>Better Resolutions</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our plans may or may not be God’s plans. If we want to be successful with
    any New Year’s resolution, we must seek God’s will.

    We believe that man was created in the image of God, before whom he walked
    in holiness and purity, but that by voluntary disobedience and
    transgression, he fell from the Eden of purity and innocence to the depths
    of sin and iniquity, and that in consequence of this, all mankind are
    sinners sold unto Satan, sinners not by constraint but by choice, shapened
    in iniquity and utterly void by nature of that holiness required by the law
    of God, positively inclined to evil, guilty and without excuse, justly
    deserving the condemnation of a just and holy God.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>God created Mankind to reflect His image(Gen.1:26-27)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The repetition of the plural pronouns in reference to God here is very
    striking: “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness” (1:26).
    Some Jewish scholars had explained this away from the truth. They said God
    was talking to the angels. But Scripture is clear that God did not consult
    the angels when He created man (Isa.40:12-26; 44:24). The plural pronoun
    here teaches us the doctrine of the Trinity which is revealed later in the
    revelation of that doctrine. Here we see a consultation among the persons
    of the Godhead prior to the creation of man. There is one God, but He
    exists in three eternal, co-equal Persons; the same in substance, but
    distinct in subsistence. This is impossible for our finite minds to grasp.
    But it is the clear revelation of Scripture. Man in God’s image is one
    (“him”) and yet is plural (“male and female”); and in body, soul and
    spirit.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Another thing is that, it is affirmed three times over (1:27) that God
    created man “in His image” which is emphasized twice. There is no room for
    harmonizing the Genesis account with an evolutionary origin of man as some
    scientists had propounded. God created man distinct from animals. Only man
    is made in God’s image. We are made in the image of God by reflecting
    God-likeness in a limited way with His personality, intelligence, and
    ability to know and relate (Eph.4:24; Col.3:10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Also, part of the divine image involves the submission of the Son to the
    Father in the context of equality. The Father and the Son are equal in
    personhood, both possessing all the attributes of deity. But in order to
    carry out the divine purpose, the Son voluntarily submitted to the Father.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The fact that human beings have been created in God’s image has many
    practical implications.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    First, unless you are rightly related to the Creator, your life has no
    lasting purpose. You are born, grow up, live a few years trying to make a
    comfortable existence, but your body too soon grows old and you die
    (assuming you don’t die sooner)!
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    That every human, male and female, is created in God’s image also means
    that human life is valuable and every person must be treated with respect.
    The unborn baby is not to be killed because it is not convenient to have a
    child, or because the parents prefer having a boy instead of a girl. Even
    if that child is deformed or mentally deficient, it is still human life,
    valuable in God’s sight. At the other end of life, the elderly, even those
    who can no longer think clearly, must be treated with dignity and care.
    Abortion and euthanasia cheapen the value of human life. This doctrine also
    is the basis for treating women with the same respect granted to men,
    because the text is clear that the female, as well as the male, is created
    in the divine image.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>God created Mankind to rule over creation (Gen.1:28)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This passage speaks of dominion. God gave man the right of dominion over
    all living things. The command to subdue it (1:28) implies that there was
    work involved, even in the perfect setting of the Garden, to bring the
    creation under man’s rightful dominion. This dominion involves a
    stewardship of the earth and its resources under the sovereignty of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Man ruled creation before the fall. But when Satan got man to obey him,
    then Satan became the ruler of this world. For man to regain his rightful
    place of dominion over this world, he must exercise dominion not only over
    the material world, but also over the spiritual forces of darkness (Eph.
    6:10-20). This can only be gained by becoming a member of the body of
    Christ, the Head, who through His resurrection has been elevated to the
    place of dominion over all things (Eph. 1:19-23). And so a major part of
    our purpose as the church is to exercise dominion for Christ over Satan and
    his forces through spiritual warfare.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The practical implication of our ruling over creation is that we must put
    on the full armour of God and, especially, become people of prayer (Eph.
    6:13-17, esp. 18-19). So God put us on this earth to reflect His image and
    to rule over creation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>
        God created Man to reproduce godly offspring (Gen.1 :28-31)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>“Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it”</em>
    (1:28). This is both God’s pronouncement of blessing as well as His
    delegation of responsibility. The blessing of sharing in God’s creative
    process by producing offspring was given to other living things besides man
    (1:22, 24-25). But man alone was commanded not only to fill the earth, but
    also to subdue it. This requires not only bearing children, but rearing
    godly children who will properly subdue the earth under God. By producing
    ungodly children, man only fills the earth but does not subdue it.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In applying this verse to our present day, the Roman Catholics have taken
    it to mean that birth control is wrong and that the major purpose of
    marriage is to bear children. Also, many Protestants would advocate not
    practicing any form of artificial birth control but to have as many
    children as possible. But we need to be careful to apply the verse
    correctly. I saw in the social media today, a picture of a couple with 13
    boys but still want to continue until they will have a girl. What if God
    does not give them a girl, should the woman go on until she wears out and
    die?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Clearly, the text does not mean that every person must get married and have
    children to fulfil God’s purpose. Neither Jesus nor the apostle Paul would
    have qualified if it means that. But it means that children are to be
    viewed as blessings from God. That needs to be said in our day when many
    couples choose not to have children so they can selfishly pursue their
    careers and materialistic lifestyles. Our children are one of the greatest
    blessings and biggest responsibilities God entrusts to us. We need to take
    the time and effort to see each child come to know Christ and to be trained
    in His ways. I pray God will put increase into our efforts of raising godly
    children. Mankind cannot reflect God’s image, rule over His creation, and
    reproduce godly offspring unless they live under the lordship of Jesus
    Christ.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God made us individually as male and female in our marriages and
    corporately as His church, <em>to reflect His image</em> by being godly
    people. He made us to <em>rule over His creation</em> as responsible
    stewards of the earth, and to rule over the ruler of this fallen world as
we exercise the authority of Christ our Head through prayer. He made us to    <em>reproduce godly offspring</em>, both in our families and in our church
    family through bearing spiritual children. That’s why God created people.
    You will be restless, confused, or lacking in fulfilment until you begin
    living in line with God’s purpose for creating you.

<p class="article"> 
    In the beginning, God created; that is, God worked. But God worked for the
    joy and pleasure of it (Gen.1:31a).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As soon as God created Adam and Eve, He commissioned them to continue the
    creative work He began through procreation (vv. 26–28). Here, God commands
    humankind to have dominion and subdue the created world. God commissions
    Adam and Eve into the work of creating and caring for the earth. This is an
    example of power sharing. The Hebrew term for dominion (radâ) means
    caregiving and nurturing, not exploitation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Similarly, the Hebrew term for subdue (kabaš) refers to developing the
    created order. Thus, God commands us to nurture and develop the world to
    its fullest potential. He calls us to continue developing what He first
    created. Work, as modelled by God in Genesis, is a creative, caring
    process. God’s expression of work includes power sharing with others.
    Lastly, work should create opportunities for humankind and creation to
    flourish in the dominion power.

        We believe that man was created in the image of God, before whom he

        transgression, he fell from the Eden of purity and innocence to the
        depths of sin and iniquity, and that in consequence of this, all
        mankind are sinners sold unto Satan, sinners not by constraint but by
        choice, shapened in iniquity and utterly void by nature of that
        holiness required by the law of God, positively inclined to evil,
        guilty and without excuse, justly deserving the condemnation of a just
        and holy God.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Immediate Results Of Their Sin</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Eyes were opened (Genesis 3:7)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    They got to know good and evil and in that sense became like God (3:22).
    So, the serpent’s promise came true, but they got MORE. While God has
    knowledge of good and evil, evil never has a controlling part. This shows
    God’s remarkable will and holiness! But for man, this knowledge of good and
    evil came by becoming subject to the control of evil, transfer of their
    rulership to Satan and loss of the very ideal of life as God designed it.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In knowing good and evil, they lost the free access to the tree of life,
    which if they had not eaten would have lived forever.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The irony is that the excellence of their faculties was infinitely
    depressed. This is where mankind is today. He does not even have a proper
    perspective of God, His creation, the future, goodness and the other
    attributes God originally gave to man. His will, mind and heart were all at
    once stained. Man might consider himself good, but just by observing the
    world in general or a person in particular, the debate is quickly over.
    With ample proof, man has fallen into a world of sin.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Guilt, shame, loss of innocence.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Considering all that resulted from the fall of man, one can list the
    following as some of such results which emanated from their disobedience
    relating to their guilt.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>1. </strong>
    <strong>They knew they were naked (Genesis 3:7 cp. 2:25)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    They were ashamed. At least, they were honest about that. They tried to
    cover up their nakedness with sewed fig leaves. God considered it
    inadequate and provided better set of clothes with the animal skin
    (Gen.3:21).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>2. </strong>
    <strong>They hid from God’s presence (Genesis 3:8 -10)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    They had to hide because of sin. Sin does not make us want to go to God as
    it brings a fear of God’s presence (distinct from the healthy fear that
    aspires into God’s presence). “For everyone who does evil hates the light,
    and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed” (John
    3:20).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>3. </strong>
    <strong>They passed the blame (Genesis 3:12)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Other consequences include blaming others (‘buck-passing’) and denial of
    one’s personal responsibility. This hiding of sin is just another form of
    hiding from God. One is not willing to admit to one’s fault unless he feels
    hopelessly exposed. It is much easier to point someone’s attention to
    another than to admit that what has been done was due to one’s own wrong
    doing.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>4. </strong>
    <strong>They deceived and made excuses (Genesis 3:13)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The woman also passes the buck but at least admits that she was deceived.
    Unfortunately, this could be noticed only after the deception had worked
    its end; when it was too late to change the fact. Usually, this is the only
    time people will confess their sins when they are confronted and know there
    is no escape.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Deception</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>This is the essence of the enemy of God and of our souls!</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Deceit is admission to inferiority. The serpent is evil because he deceives
    to get what he otherwise could not have. The serpent only could bait
    mankind through deceit. It was through deceit that he himself fell and used
    it to seed rebellion among mankind. So, what did the serpent get for his
    deception? He got control which was only for a short time, “He must be
    released for a short time” (Revelation 20:3) before his catastrophic and
    humiliating end. The light by nature is powerful where darkness is only
    present because of an absence of light. The evil one therefore only can
    continue as he continues his dark understanding. When God’s truth is
    revealed, he wilts away.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The death they experienced could in no way be compared to the fruit of
    obedience. The contrast is so great that we can hardly comprehend why not
    only Eve but Adam fell into disobedience. The unfolding of the ‘surely die’
    will continue on in the following chapters. There is a physical death that
    is delayed. Spiritual death took place instantly. This death pervades
    through human history. Only in Christ Jesus do we see God interrupting this
    cycle of death with life in Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Long term results of their sin</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Adam subjected all his progeny to the dominion of sin for eternity. In
    fact, we shall see later that it is God, in His wisdom, mercy and grace,
    who immediately took steps to prevent this from happening in a way that
    could not be reversed (Genesis 3:23-24).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Man was chased out of the Garden</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God gave him orders to depart immediately; sent or put him away as a man
    does his wife, when he divorces her; or as a prince banishes a rebellious
    subject. However, he did not send him to hell at once, as he did the
    apostate angels.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Man was to eat out of his sweat</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Man became a tiller of the ground, from where he was taken and where he
    will return in order for him to eat and get provisions. He must labour
    hard, in digging and ploughing, in planting and sowing, so that he might
    get a livelihood. He was driven to a field of land probably near Eden. Some
    say it was a field near Damascus.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Man has fallen</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We see the shame, the loss of the glory of God, rebellion and disconnect.
    The Lord in His wonderful and gracious way has made a way through Christ
    where our stain is not only removed, but we gain the righteousness of
    Christ through which we can live as if we are righteous. Only when we see
    Him, however, will this redemptive process be fully completed to His glory
    and grace.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In choosing to ignore God while exercising their free will, Adam and Eve
    suffered the very consequences of God’s warning. Man is responsible to God
    even though he has a free will. With freedom, there is responsibility. With
    responsibility, there is accountability. As a people, we need to trust Him
    enough to obey Him or be consumed by our desires to gain what is vain
    though inordinate ambition.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If only Eve and Adam had taken God at His word, they would not have fallen.
    They only had to put the Lord and His will above their own, and all would
    have been fine. In making decisions, small or great, we need to
    persistently prioritize putting the clearly defined will and principles of
    God in action. God will never ask us to set aside His will to obtain His
    promises (John 17:17). Natural man is no longer innocent but fallen.
    However, in Christ, the second Adam, through faith, the people of God are
    alive and able to live in obedience.

    <strong>The Fall of Man</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Volumes have been written about the fall of man. Man was made in the image
    of God. People differently state what that means largely because it depends
    upon what they think man lost. If for example, we consider the ability to
    make decisions through reason is part of that image of God, then we will
    believe man has not completely lost the image of God after the fall. He can
    still make such decisions even though they are based after a corrupt will.
    The basic argument is whether man has completely lost the image of God or
    partially lost this image. Again, one’s interpretation of image of God
    largely defines a person’s conclusion in whether he has completely or
    partially lost the image of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Fortunately, Colossians 3:10 lets us know that we now are being renewed in
    that image as Christ lives in us (Colossians 3:10). John tells us, however,
    that this image will not be completed until we see Christ (1 John 3:2).

    <em>
        We believe that man was created in the image of God, before whom he
        walked in holiness and purity, but that by voluntary disobedience and
        transgression, he fell from the Eden of purity and innocence to the
        depths of sin and iniquity, and that in consequence of this, all
        mankind are sinners sold unto Satan, sinners not by constraint but by
        choice, shapened in iniquity and utterly void by nature of that
        holiness required by the law of God, positively inclined to evil,
        guilty and without excuse, justly deserving the condemnation of a just
        and holy God.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The vast majority of people believe that the earth has always been as it is
    today. They maintain that in order to determine what happened in the past,
    one must presume that the earth always functioned basically as it is now
    with conflict and death, vastly different climates, radical changes in the
    weather, catastrophes, natural disasters, survival of the fittest and such
    like. But the Bible, however, refutes this false presupposition. When God
    completed His 6-day creation process, He declared that everything was "very
    good", (Gen 1:31). But then, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, mankind and
    the earth were decreed by God to reflect mankind's fallen condition (Gen.
    3:14-19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <a name="IIB4a2">
        <strong>I. </strong>
        <strong>Physical &amp; Spiritual Death of Mankind </strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
At first Adam was warned by God that disobedience would lead    <a name="gen2v17">to physical and spiritual death (Gen. 2:16-17</a>). The
    word, "you will surely die!" can also be seen in I Sam. 14:44; 22:16 and 1
    Kgs. 2:37, and the intended meaning is one of emphatically declaring the
    death of an individual. And because of the two natures of the man who was
    created in the image of God - physical and spiritual- this emphatic
    certainty of death implies two kinds of death, evidently immediate
    spiritual death; then eventually, physical death (Gen. 2:7). Adam did not
    immediately die physically, but he began to die gradually. He lived to be
    930 years old (Gen. 5:5). Adam's immediate spiritual death, which is
    spiritual separation from God, is evident in Scripture when he and Eve
    attempted to hide from God who they used to understand as Omniscient, which
means all kn    <a name="IIB4a2gen3v8">owing. No man can hide from Him (Gen. 3:8</a>).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    So, "on that very day" (Gen 2:17), Adam and Eve died spiritually as
    evidenced by their trying to hide from an Omniscient God, thus showing an
    ignorance and an alienation from Him, whereas before, they were in an
    intimate relationship with Him. And "on that day" Adam, as the
    representative of the human race, ensured that all of humanity would be
    born spiritually dead and that all new born babies would inherit a sin
    nature and spiritual death through his seed as it passed on from generation
    to generation. And so, mankind and nature were sadly changed. Man's
    offspring would now reflect this change so that no longer could God treat
    man as He did <a name="IIB4a2gen3v23">before (Gen 3:22-23</a>).The Lord God
    banished him from the Garden to work the ground from which he had been
    taken."
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <a name="IIB4a3">
        <strong>II. </strong>
        <strong>Changes in The Earth, Its Life forms</strong>
    </a>
    <strong> and in the Serpent</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Then everything changed, mankind, all living things and the whole earth
    itself. So, the passage of Gen. 3:14-19 which is now under consideration
    starts with God's pronouncement on the serpent which serves the purpose of
    reminding future generations of Satan's continual deceptions and mankind's
    fallen condition. Part of this pronouncement includes God's curse on
mankind, as well as on plant and anim    <a name="IIB4a3bgen3v14">al life and on the earth itself (Gen. 3:14)</a>.
    It might not 'eat dust' in a literal sense, of course, except in the sense
    that its prey would have to be consumed directly off the ground in front of
    it. The expression is mainly a graphic figure of speech indicating its
    humiliating judgment and fall.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Lest anyone complains at God's seeming “injustice”, since the serpent as an
    animal was not to blame for Satan's corrupt possession of its body, he
    should remember that the 'potter hath power over the clay.' Each animal had
    been made for a specific mode of life and with specific structures
    appropriate to such a mode. There were many other 'creeping things,' and
    God now made the serpent to join this group, for reason of the symbolism
    involved; but snakes, as animals, are no more capable of resentment at this
    lot than are moles and worms.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It should be noted also that all other animals were brought under the curse
    at this time, though none of them had 'sinned.' The serpent was merely
    cursed 'above all' the rest, but 'every beast' henceforth had the 'sentence
    of death' in its members. Each was a part of man's dominion and it was by
    man's sin that death came into the world, infecting everything in that
    dominion.

<p class="article">

        <strong>III. </strong>
        <strong>There Is Continual &amp; Bitter Conflict On the Earth</strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <a name="in_the_same_way">
        In the same way, by faith, Eve is the spiritual mother of all believers
        throughout the ages. First of all, Eve herself is a believer having
        trusted in God's plan of salvation
    </a>
    . And as a result of the faith expressed by Adam and Eve in God's plan of
    salvation, i.e., the coming Messiah Jesus Christ, God provided His born
    again children, Adam and Eve, animal skins which symbolized their
acceptance of the sacrifice that God alone would make for the sins of all    <a name="IIB4a3cgen3v21">mankind (Gen. 3:21). </a>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Just as it states in Gen. 3:15, other Scripture passages also indicate that
there is tremendous enmity between believers and Satan throughout all the    <a name="IIB4a3c1pet5v8">ages [1 Peter 5:8]</a>. So, God refers to this
    adversary of Satan as being the seed of the woman, a human being born of a
    woman's seed. Since the man provides the seed, this will be a supernatural
    birth, none other than Jesus Christ, the only One who was so born.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Not only would victory not be as easy as he thought, but ultimately he
    would be completely defeated and destroyed. 'There will come One who will
    not be of the man's seed, and who therefore will not be under your
    dominion. He will be uniquely the Seed of the woman, miraculously conceived
    and virgin-born. Though you will succeed in grievously injuring Him, He
    will completely crush you and all your evil ambitions.'
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This great promise in Genesis 3:15 has long been known as the
    ‘prot-evangelium’ (the 'first gospel''), promising the ultimate coming and
    victory of the Redeemer.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    But first, there is seen a time of conflict and even apparent victory on
    the part of the serpent, who is able to 'bruise the heel' of the woman's
    seed. Specifically, it appears that Satan's seed consists of those who
    knowingly and willfully set themselves at enmity with the seed of the
    woman. They partake in a very specific sense of the character of the
    Adversary (John 8:44; Ephesians 2:2, 3) and seek to oppose God's purposes
    in creation and redemption.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The 'seed of the woman' on the other hand, would refer in the first place
    to those in the human family who are brought into right relationship with
    God through faith, children of the Father. The primary seed of the woman
    is, of course, the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This promise is, of course, fulfilled in Jesus Christ. He appeared to be
    mortally wounded when He died on the cross, but He rose again and soon will
    return to cast the devil into the lake of fire (Rev.20:10). The promised
    Seed would one day be born of a human woman, but Satan was left in the dark
    as to which woman and at what time. Both he and Eve may have thought
    initially it would be her firstborn son. Later on, as the centuries passed,
    Satan continued his attacks against all the males born in the promised
    line, particularly those who were objects of special prophetic interest
    (e.g., Noah, Abraham, Jacob, David), in case one of them might be the
    promised Seed."

        It had been appointed to her to be the 'mother of all living'
        (Gen.3:20), but now, her children to all generations would suffer under
        the curse. Their very entrance into the world would be marked by unique
        suffering, serving as a perpetual reminder of the dreaded effects of
        sin.
    </a>

<p class="article"> 
    The function of reproduction and motherhood was originally given as the
    joyful fruition of God's purpose in her creation. However, it is now marred
    so severely by her 'lust' for withheld knowledge, which conceived and
    brought forth sin and death (Jam.1:15). It would thus be marked by unique
    suffering in its accomplishment. Furthermore, she who had acted
    independently of her husband in her fateful decision to taste the desired
    fruit, must henceforth exercise her desire only to her husband and he would
    bear rule over her. The special curse on woman associated with
    child-bearing can, in fact, be turned to a blessing for a woman yielded to
    the will of God. Jesus said: 'A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow,
    because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she
    remembered no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world'
    (John 16:21).

    "In conclusion, we find ourselves faced with an important issue. The earth
    which had previously cooperated readily as the man 'tilled' and 'dressed
    it' (Genesis 2:5, 15), now became reluctant to yield its food. Instead, it
    began to yield thorns and noxious weeds, requiring toil and sweat and tears
    before man could 'eat of it.' And finally, in spite of all his struggle,
    death would triumph and man's body would return to the dust from which it
    was taken.

    The curse on man himself was fourfold:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1) sorrow, resulting from continual disappointment and futility;
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2) pain and suffering, signified by the 'thorns' which intermittently
    hinder man in his efforts to provide a living for his family,
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3) sweat, or tears, the 'strong crying' of intense struggle against a
    hostile environment; and finally,
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4) physical death, which would eventually triumph over all man's efforts,
    with the structure of his body returning to the simple elements of the
    earth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    But Christ, as Son of Man and second Adam, has been made the curse for us
    (Galatians 3:13). He was the 'man of sorrows' (Isaiah 53:3); acquainted
    more with grief than any other man, He was wounded, bruised, and chastised
    for us (Isaiah 53:5), and indeed wore the very thorns of the curse as His
    crown (Mk.15:17); in the agony of His labour, His sweat as it were drops of
    blood (Luke 22:44), and 'offered up prayers and supplications with strong
    crying and tears' (Heb.5:7). And, finally, God brought Him into the 'dust
    of death' (Ps. 22:15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Therefore, because He bore all the curse Himself for us, once again, the
    dwelling of God shall someday be with men and 'there shall be no more death
    neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the
    former things are passed away" (Rev.21:4; 22:3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Although the complete removal of the curse awaits the return of Christ to
    purge and renovate the earth (II Peter 3:10; Revelation 20:11; 21:1), He
    has already paid the price for its redemption (I Peter 1:18-20), not with
    'corruptible things' (which could never redeem anything under the 'bondage
    of corruption') but with His 'precious blood,' by the 'incorruptible word'
    (I Peter 1:23).

<p class="article"> 
    We believe that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, the Just for
    the unjust; freely, and by divine appointment of the Father, taking the
    sinner’s place, bearing his sins, receiving his condemnation, dying his
    death, fully paying his penalty, and signing with His life’s blood, the
    pardon of every one who should believe upon Him; that upon simple faith and
    acceptance of the atonement purchased on Mount Calvary, the vilest sinner
    may be cleansed of his iniquities and made whiter than driven snow.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In this lesson, we shall be discussing the necessity of the blood in
    atoning for sin. Redemption can be done with money or other materials in
    some cases, but not for sin, which pertains to human life. So, life is
    required for the redemption of life. However, we shall see how the blood of
    animals is insufficient for cleansing sin.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Redemption by Blood – Leviticus 17:11</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Redemption, according to dictionary definitions, can mean any of the
    following: to set one free by paying a ransom; to buy back something pawned
    or mortgaged; or ‘to tear loose’ from a dominating oppressing force. In
    1Peter 1:18, we read, “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
    corruptible things as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received
    by tradition from your fathers.” Here, we are made to understand that only
    blood is sufficient for redemption from sin. This is confirmed in Leviticus
    17:11 which states that, “The life of the flesh is in the blood and I have
    given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is
    the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.” We can safely conclude
    therefore that without the shedding of blood, there can be no forgiveness
    of sin (Hebrews 9:22).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Redemption in the Old Testament – Exodus 12:1-7</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    After man sinned in the Garden of Eden, God covered his nakedness with
    animal skin which implies that God made a sacrifice with animal blood to
    bring about the reunion between Him and the fallen mankind. God desires to
    fellowship with His children and for this to continue, regular sacrifice
    was necessary. Hence, God introduced the use of animal blood to serve as a
    type of the once and for all sacrifice that will be made with the blood of
    the Lamb of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For continuity in the fellowship with, and the worship of God, Cain’s
    sacrifice was rejected; an indication of fellowship with God. While
    instituting the Old Testament Covenant with animal blood, Moses was
    instructed by God in Exodus 24:1-8 to pour half of the animal blood on the
    altar while the remaining half should be sprinkled upon the Israelites.
    However, we are told in Hebrew 10:4, “For it is not possible for the blood
    of bulls and of goats should take away sins.” Why then did God introduce
    the Old Testament sacrifice? As someone puts it, “animal sacrifice is to
    serve as credit until Christ comes to settle the debt with His own blood.”
    Meyer Pearlman puts it this way, “There was nothing in the blood of an
    irrational creature which could effect the spiritual redemption of souls;
    that could only be by the offering of a perfect human life.” Only the blood
    of Jesus cleanses from sin.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Redemption In The New Testament – John 1:36</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Hebrews 10:5, it is written, “Wherefore when He cometh into the world,
    He saith, SACRIFICE AND OFFERING THOU WOULDETH NOT, BUT A BODY HAST THOU
    PREPARED FOR ME:” Jesus was given a human body so as to have blood for a
    perfect sacrifice. Paul declared in Acts 20:28 that God purchased the
    church with His own blood while in John’s first Epistle, it is written that
    the blood of Jesus Christ, cleanses from sin (1John 1:7b). We can therefore
    humbly and gratefully acknowledge with faith that:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Christ died for the unjust – Romans 5:8; 1Peter 3:18.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Christ took the sinner’s place -Titus 2:14; Isaiah 53:5.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. Christ paid the penalty for sin – Gal. 1:4; 1John 2:2.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. Christ signed man’s pardon with His blood-1Peter 1:18-19; Romans 5:9.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5. Christ provided cleansing for the vilest sinner – Isaiah 1:18; John
    3:16; Hebrews 7:25.

    <strong>Conclusion /Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In redemption, Christ took the place of the sinner, to bear the penalty of
    sin and to meet the demands of the law for His people. We should always
    remember that redemption is intended to bring us back to a place where we
    can actively fellowship, worship and serve God in holiness and
    righteousness, all the days of our life.

    In Exodus chapter 12, God gave Moses instructions on how to observe the
    Passover. Though the feast was observed in each Israelite home, their
    united and simultaneous worship would help weld them together as a single
    community. The blood of the animals was to be placed on the doorframes of
    the houses as a sign and mark of separation. The sprinkled blood on the
    Israelites' houses provided protection from death when God destroyed the
    Egyptian firstborn. The slaying of the animals, and the sprinkling of blood
    prefigured the substitutionary death of Christ. He is "our Passover Lamb"
    (1 Cor. 5:7), "a Lamb without blemish or defect" (1 Peter 1:19; cf. John
    1:29).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The sacrifice of Jesus is the means whereby individual believers escape the
    horrors of spiritual death. Thus under the protection of shed blood, the
    congregation was to be reminded of cleansing from sin (Heb 9:22). As the
    blood of an animal was the means of deliverance and of escaping death (in
    O/T), so Christ's blood is the means of redemption for believers (Rom 5:9;
    Eph 1:7), which brings to end the observance of yearly sacrifices for sin.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We believe that the salvation of sinners is wholly through grace; that we
    have no righteousness or goodness of our own wherewith to seek divine
    favour, and must come, therefore, throwing ourselves upon the unfailing
    mercy and love of Him who bought us and washed us in His own blood,
    pleading the merits and the righteousness of Christ the Saviour, standing
    upon His word and accepting the free gift of love and pardon.

    A. <strong>Purpose and power of God.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These are days of many bumper stickers that are used to preach the Gospel.
There was one that was seen recently by a brother and it reads:    <strong><em>“We could wreck the world”, but “Jesus saves”.</em></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Apostle Paul’s theology is not written on the back of a truck; it is
    recorded in Ephesians 2. There, he summarizes the condition of mankind, the
    kindness of God, and the nature of the salvation which He has provided for
    lost men in Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Ephesians chapter 1, Paul focused our attention on the purpose of God
    and on the power of God, which assure the Christian of the blessings which
    God has provided in Christ. The final verses of chapter 1 concern the great
    power of God which He has vested in Jesus Christ, through His resurrection
    and ascension.

    <strong>Contents of Ephesians 2:1-10</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This passage contains three main segments:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1) The fallen man, and his hopeless condition-dead (Vs 1-3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2) God, with His mercy and grace for man’s salvation (Vs 4-6).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3) Purpose of salvation, to the praise of His glory (Vs 7-10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All together, they spell out the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Although He had died for the sins of the world, God raised Jesus from the
    dead, and taking Him back into heaven where He seated Him at His right
    hand. He invested Him with authority and power greater than any and all
    other authorities. Along with this authority and power, He was appointed as
    Head of the church, which is the earthly manifestation of His presence and
    which fills up that which remains of His ministry on earth before His
    second coming.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Man’s Condition: Dead in Sin (Eph.2:1-3)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If Ephesians 1:19-23 takes us to the heights in exploring the power and
    authority of the risen and ascended Christ, chapter 2:1-3 takes us to the
    very depths, as Paul expounds the powerless, hopeless, lifeless condition
    of fallen men, who are enslaved by their own fleshly desires, and dominated
    by the world around them and by Satan.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Consider the contrast between Christ’s position and ours. Christ is alive
    because of His righteousness, but we are dead, because of our sins. Christ
    is exalted, seated in the heavens; we are on and of the earth. Christ has
    been given power and authority over all other powers and authorities; we
    were subject to the powers and authorities.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The Irony of fallen Man’s Dilemma</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The irony of fallen man’s dilemma is that he doesn’t even realize his
    condition until after he is saved.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Lost men, blinded and deceived by Satan, think they are really “living,”
    when in reality, they are dead.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. They think that by living in sin, they are enjoying life to its fullest,
    but they are not.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. They suppose that they are free, subject to no one,<sup> </sup>but they
    are really enslaved.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The lost Men are Dead.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. To be dead is to be lifeless.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. To be dead is to be unable to help oneself.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. To be dead is to be absolutely powerless.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5. To be dead is to be beyond hope (in the eyes of the world).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>Death is ultimately the result of sin.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In today’s text, Paul examines some of the contributing factors to our sin
    from various Bible points.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. First, men are sinners because they are born that way.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. We were, “by nature, children of wrath.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. We were sinners, subject to the wrath of God because of our sin nature,
    which we obtained at birth (Ps. 51: 5; Rom. 5:12).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Second, men sin and are therefore sinners because they follow the world
    in its course of sin and rebellion.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. Sinners love and seek companions, co-sinners, to share in the excitement
    and (unknowingly) in the penalty of sin (Prov. 1:8-19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. This is why the Bible instructs us to avoid being pressured by the world
    to conform to its values and lifestyle.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. Third, unbelievers sin because they are unwittingly subject to the
    influence of Satan.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. Finally, men are sinners because they follow the dictates of the flesh
    (Rom. 7:7-25; Gal.5:16-21).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>
        Paul unites the Jews and the Gentiles in the common condition.
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. What is most interesting is that it is here that Paul chooses to unite
    the Jews and the Gentiles in the common condition of sin and death.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What affects the Gentiles also affects the Jews as well.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. The Jews thought that they were born “special,” because of their
    physical descent from Abraham.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5. They were not better than the Gentiles.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    6. In some ways, it was true that the Jews were less addicted to the
    fleshly sins of sexual immorality and idolatry compared to the Gentiles.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    7. In and of ourselves, and apart from God, we are desperately and
    hopelessly lost.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    8. We are not just “sick,” we are “dead.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    9. We are without life, without hope, without potential, without “worth.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    10. Any value we may have, or any hope, must come from Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    11. This is the good news of the gospel, and that which Paul explains next
    in verses 4-6.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>God’s Grace: Alive in Christ (2:4-6)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The condition of men in sin is not hopeless or terminal because God has
    come to the rescue of fallen men through His provision in Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Paul begins with the motivation of God, by His mercy which prompted Him to
    provide a way of escape from our condition of sin and eternal death.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Expression of God’s love.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The expression of God’s love for us is salvation by grace.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Grace - unmerited favour
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Grace means that God provides salvation of a sinner without the sinner
    meriting salvation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Man’s Acceptance of God’s love.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    While God has provided the means of grace (Jesus) man has a part in that
    salvation - Faith.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Salvation by faith simply means accepting what God has told us to do
    concerning salvation and obeying Him. (Matthew 7:21; Hebrews 5:8-9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. God’s love is not a response, but a cause.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our love for God is prompted by His love for us, a love which initiates our
    love in response: (1 John 4:19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God’s love for us is vastly different from our love for Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    He loved us while we were His enemies, while we were still dead in our sins
    and transgressions.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God’s mercy is not prompted by our potential or by any qualities we think
    we possess, but by our own pathetic condition.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Divine grace was not bestowed on us because we were so worthy, or because
    God found anything good in us, but because of the goodness which is in God
    Himself.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God sent Jesus Christ to the world, to suffer and to die in the sinner’s
    place.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God’s grace and salvation does not come to us in various forms, from which
    we may choose.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    His grace has been poured out to us lavishly in Christ, and in Him alone.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>
        God’s Purpose: The Praise of the Glory for His Grace (2:7-10)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>We are saved for His glory.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God’s purposes are not merely temporal, they are eternal. God’s purpose in
    saving sinners is not just to make men happy, to provide blessings, or to
    enable men to escape the torments of hell but for His Pleasure -Rev 4:11.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Whether it be in the punishment of the wicked or in the salvation of
    sinners by grace, God is working out all things to His own glory. God will
    not share His glory with any other being, and thus the work of salvation is
    entirely His work. Grace is divine favour which is undeserved.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>
        We are saved to work with and for God as His workmanship-(Ephesians
        2:10).
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. We are created for the purpose of good works (Titus 2:14).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. God wants us to be active in good works (Col. 1:10; 2. Tit. 2:7;
    Matt.5:16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. We will be judged according to our works or continued obedience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As saints, we are what we are because of His doing. We are a new creation
    in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), but we are His creation. He created us in
    Jesus Christ. Any good works which we might do as Christians are the works
    which He foreordained, which He planned and prepared in eternity past. We
    dare not take credit for them.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our passage today sets before us the glorious difference between what we
    once were, apart from Christ, and what we now are, in Christ. The good news
    of the gospel is that we need not remain dead in our transgressions and
    sin, separated from God and destined for wrath. God has provided a way of
    salvation, one way by which sinners can become saints. And this “way” is
    Jesus Christ (John 14:6).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If you are a Christian, this text should serve as a reminder of what you
    once were, and of what you now are, in Christ. It should produce both
    humility and gratitude. It should stimulate you to love and good deeds,
    knowing that even the good works which you do are those which God has
    accomplished in and through you, for His glory.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If you cannot rejoice in these truths, then now is an opportunity for you
    to receive them for yourself. Christ died for our sins, so that we need not
    suffer the penalty of death. Christ rose from the dead and was ascended to
    the right hand of the Father. In Christ, we too are assured of our
    resurrection from the dead, and of our position with God in the heavenly
    realms. All we must do is to agree with God concerning our condition, as
    outlined in Ephesians 2:1-3, and to receive Jesus Christ as God’s provision
    for our salvation, as explained in verses 4-6. In Christ we cease to be
    what we once were, and we forever continue to be what Christ is. This is
    the message of the Cross and of our movement. It is one of our 22 tenets of
    Faith.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance is basically turning from one’s sinful path (past) and turning
    to God in a 180 degree change of direction. This turning however involves
    feeling of godly sorrow for sin and holding on to the special grace of
    Calvary without turning back to one’s old vomit. Repentance involves the
    exercise of human will to decide whether to turn back from the broad way of
    perdition to the narrow way of life. It requires a firm decision on whom to
    follow and serve. (Joshua 24:14-15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Hearing The Word of God</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Spiritual journey involves an encounter with the word of life. The Bible
    says, “So, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans
    10:17). Verse 14 says “how then shall they call on him whom they have not
    believed and how shall they hear without a preacher.” It is the word of God
    that generates faith and understanding. Repentance follows the hearing of
    the word of God, and responding to it rather than hardening our hearts
    (Psalm 95:7-8; Hebrews 3:15). The call of Jesus in Matt.11:28 is still
    fresh. He says, "Come to me all you who are weary and burdened, and I will
    give you rest.” We must carry this message to the people so that they can
    repent by turning from the broad way of perdition to God for redemption.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Believing The Gospel</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance is always a product of personal conviction through faith. This
    faith flows from the word of God (Romans 10:9-10,14,17). Faith is a
    spiritual persuasion as it applies to the invisible. The Bible says, "For
    it is with your heart that you believe, and it is with your mouth that you
    confess and are saved" (Rom. 10: 10). It is after this that the power for
    adoption as a child of God is released. The Bible says, “Yet, to all who
    received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave right to become
    children of God, children born not of natural descent nor of human decision
    or husband’s will, but born of God” (John 1:12-13). The component of this
    belief includes the belief that:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. Every man is a sinner (Romans 3:23)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iii. Our righteousness cannot save us (Isaiah 64:6;Romans 3:30)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iv. Jesus has paid for our sins on the cross of Calvary (John 19:30)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    v. The righteousness of God is now available to us by Grace (Romans 5:19;
    6:21-22. Isaiah 54: 17)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    vi. If we confess Jesus as Lord and believe in him, we shall be saved
    (Romans 10:9-10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    vii. Our salvation is not by the works we have done but by grace (Eph.
    2:8-9)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Turning From Sinful Past To God</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The basic world order is between evil and good or light and darkness.
    Apostle Paul said in Rom. 7:6, “The mind of the sinful man is death, but
    the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace; the sinful mind is
    hostile to God. It does not submit to God’s law nor can it do so. Those
    controlled by the sinful nature can’t please God" (Rom. 8:7-8). When a
    person hears the word of God and is convicted of his/her sinful past, such
    a person has taken the first major step of repentance. Anyone who cannot
    make a “U” turn from the works of the flesh (Gal.5:19-20) to God (Matthew
    11:28) would be like the wife of Lot who was engrossed by Sodom and could
    not fully escape for her dear life. The life of Apostle Paul in Acts
    chapter 9 is a vivid description of repentance. He turned from being a
    persecutor of the gospel to a dramatic advocate of the gospel he was
    fighting against. The voluntary element of repentance involves the exercise
    of the will for repentance in form of inward turning from sinful past and a
    wholehearted turning to Christ for forgiveness (Luke 15:18-20) and being
    adopted into the family of God. John 1:12.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance is a critical step for anybody who wants a new life in Christ.
    It starts from hearing the word of God, believing it, having godly sorrow,
    confessing our sins, forsaking them and turning to God for a new
    relationship as a joint heir with Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Life Application</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A large gathering of Church leaders came for a seminar and spiritual
    impartation from a revered man of God. Many of the participants were young
    General Overseers. At a point, he was led to make an altar call. To his
    surprise, many of them came out for salvation! This shows that repentance
    is not about working for God, attending church services regularly or
    bearing Christian names. One could do all these or more and still end up in
    hell without repentance.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions and Discussion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. What does it mean to repent? It means believing the gospel and turning
    180 degrees away from past sinful life unto Christ through his saving
    grace.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What is the relationship between repentance and faith? Faith is the
    foundation upon which the structure of repentance is built. Without faith,
    no man can please or see God (Heb. 11:6).

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance is a fundamental step to be taken before a person can return to
    his God. Many are confused about it because of the wrong socio-cultural and
    ethno-religious factors in our society. The teacher should guide students
    to identify some of the above factors and deceitful activities of some
    church members and leaders which have led people to a dangerous assumption
    of trying to please God with empty religiosity without first
    re-establishing the broken relationship between God and man through
    repentance and appropriation of the grace from Calvary. This is a major
    problem for majority of unbelievers who belong to different religions and
    those who claim to be Christians but who are merely nominal church goers
    without spiritual connection with Christ through repentance and
    regeneration.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The world is filled with people who profess and claim to belong to God
    without submitting to Him. How do we reconcile a situation where people
    claim to accept Jesus as Saviour but He is not the Lord of their lives.
    They love to enjoy His grace but reject His Lordship (His yoke and light
    burden) Matthew 11:28-30. Jesus never came to dispense grace without
    responsible living and commitment. Therefore, when a person repents, he or
    she must also accept Jesus as both Saviour and Lord.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Repentance.</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance means turning away from sinful life unto God. It is a sincere
    and thorough change of the mind and disposition regarding sin. It includes
    a change of view, a change of feeling and a change of purpose. As a follow
    up to our lesson on repentance last week, we would like to discuss common
    errors and assumptions of people on repentance.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>(a) What Repentance is not?</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. It is not reformation of sinners’ moral lives. Repentance is not
    amending one’s errors to become better and more responsible. This cannot
    change the inner man.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. It is not conformity. Repentance is not an attempt to conform to
    societal standards.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iii. It is not a change of value-orientation whereby somebody reviews his
    or her background and begins to delete or remove those considered as
    embarrassing and unacceptable as people do with New Year resolutions.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iv. It is not becoming religious by getting more committed to church
    programmes, religious rites and church responsibilities. Paul was zealous
    for God before conversion. Yet, he was not born again.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    v. It is not being remorseful, which is human sorrow (unlike godly sorrow)
    or more pious and god-fearing without being born again.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>(b) What Repentance is? </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance is putting one’s faith in Christ and cleansing one's soul from
    sinful defilements (1 John5:1, John 3:8, Titus 3:5). It is the turning from
    old ways of sinful life into a righteous life in Christ and thereby
    becoming a new creation (2 Corinthians 5: 17).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Acceptance: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Acceptance is a fundamental component in the process of salvation. To
    repent from our sinful ways and turn away from them to God is very crucial
    and important. However, the next issue is how to live a successful
    Christian life. Peter told the people who heard him on the day of
    Pentecost, “Let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus whom
    you crucified both Lord and Christ”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (Act 2:36). Therefore, every believer must accept Jesus as Lord and
    Saviour.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. Acceptance as Saviour (Act 2:36). Jesus must be accepted as the Saviour
    who has paid for our sins on the Cross of Calvary. There are many types of
    opinions about Jesus, even when He was alive. Today, some see Him as a mere
    Prophet while others consider him as an outstanding Rabbai. Some others see
    him as a great miracle worker. Any idea about Jesus, no matter how
    grandiose, once it does not include His being the Saviour, it cannot profit
that individual in terms of salvation. Jesus is not just a Saviour. He is    <strong>the only Saviour</strong> (John 3:16, Acts 4:12, Rom. 10: 9-10).
    Accepting Him is not an advice, it is a mandate that people will regret in
    eternity if they fail to do so (John 3:7, 18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. Acceptance as Lord: (Act2:36). Jesus must not be accepted as Saviour
    alone, He must also be accepted as <strong>the Lord of our lives</strong>.
    Many seem to ignore this fact. Jesus is the Author and the Finisher of our
    faith. He is the Shepherd of our souls (John 10:1-5). When he said, “Come
    to me all you who are weary and burdened,” he also said, “Take my yoke upon
    you…” (Matt.11:28-30). This yoke is a bond that put our lives under His
    control as Master and Lord. Yoked animals have no room for distractions or
    independent ventures. Their destinies in their mutual assignment are bond
    together. Jesus only calms us down that “My yoke is easy and my burden is
    light” (Matt.11:30) so as to make us realize that His own Lordship is
    friendly and meant for our own good. Indeed, without Christ being the Lord
    of our lives, the devil will hijack our lives and destinies.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Repentance and acceptance are fundamental steps for us to reconcile and
    reconnect with God. Accepting Jesus as Saviour through repentance always
    transforms us into becoming new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). To continue
    in this new life, Christ must be accepted as Lord of our lives to prevent
    Satan, the enemy of our souls and our old task master from taking charge of
    our destiny again.

    <strong>Life Application</strong>

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    An unbeliever accused many Christians of going to church to lie regularly
    through their hypocritical confessions of singing and declaring "I
    surrender all" while they have surrendered nothing. Though the allegation
    may be from a hostile mind, there seems to be some elements of truth in it.
    The statement paints a picture of people who accept Christ as Saviour, but
    refuse to make Him Lord of their lives.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. What does it mean to accept Christ as Saviour? It means accepting the
    death and shedding of His blood as remission for sin which personal efforts
    (work) cannot achieve.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What does it mean to accept Christ as Lord? It means submitting our
    lives to Him and obeying Him, even when it is not convenient.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The world is apparently confused about what it means to be a Christian. An
    Indian told a missionary who was preaching to him to accept Christ. He told
    the missionary that he would accept Christ the day he met a Christian. He
    said though he agreed he was an idol worshipper, the people he met who
    professed to be Christian’s also worshipped money and materialism. The
    teacher should guide students to discuss ways by which as believers, we are
    the Epistles the world around us are reading (2 Corinthians 3vs2-3).
    Therefore, we must not only accept Christ as our Saviour alone, but also as
    the Lord of our lives so that our light will shine for the world to see.

        We believe that the change which takes place in the heart and life at
        conversion is a very real one; that the sinner is then born again in
        such a glorious and transforming manner that the old things are passed

    There are several facts about the new birth (regeneration) that need to be
    understood and they are given to us in this passage. This first part will
    discuss two and the remaining ones will be discussed in the next lesson.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Reality of The New Birth</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>The usage of the word “born” </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word “born” is used eight times in John 3:1-9. Here Jesus was talking
    about the real experience – the reality of the new birth. The new birth is
    a reality; it is as real an experience as physical birth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    No one would deny his own physical birth, and we do not have to deny our
    spiritual birth. Jesus said that the new birth is a reality.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Selected few examples</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If you would interview people who trusted Jesus, you would find out how
    real it is.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ask Peter, he knew what it was to trust in Jesus Christ and to experience
    this new birth. In his letters, Peter tells us about this matter of being
    born again.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Matthew, the publican, had his life radically changed because he trusted
    Christ and experienced the new birth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The thief on the cross turned to Jesus and said, “Remember me Lord, when
    You come into Your Kingdom” (Luke 23:42). Because of his faith in Christ,
    he was born again. Ask him whether or not it is a real experience. In John
    4, the Samaritan woman had a purposeful conversation with Jesus Christ
    beside the well, at the end of the conversation, she left her water jar and
    ran to the city with her testimony of a change life. Ask her also, she will
    tell you it was a real experience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ask the Apostle Paul, as well as Saul of Tarsus, the leading young Jewish
    rabbi of his day, was persecuting the church when he met Jesus Christ (Acts
    9:1-5). He put his faith in Jesus Christ, and was born again. It was a real
    experience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The reality of the new birth, the good news of the Gospel, is this: You can
    start all over again! You do not have to stay the way you are; you can
    start over again. Because there is such a thing as regeneration, you can be
    born again.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Simplicity of The New Birth</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Simple Illustration</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our Lord Jesus used birth as a simple illustration of what happens when a
    person is saved. Even though he was a great teacher of Israel, Nicodemus
    unfortunately misunderstood what our Lord was talking about. “How can a man
    be born when he is old?” asked Nicodemus. “Can he enter the second time
    into his mother’s womb and be born?” (John 3:4). Our Lord was talking about
    something spiritual, but Nicodemus interpreted this as something physical.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In John 4, when our<strong> </strong>Lord was talking to the woman at the
    well, He talked about living water. He said, “If you ask Me, I will give
    you water and you will never be thirsty again” (John 4:10, 14). He was
    speaking spiritually, but she took Him literally and materially, and she
    said, “How can you give me any water? You don’t even have a vessel to draw
    with (v. 11)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In John 6, our Lord was talking about eating the Bread of Life, feeding on
    His flesh and His blood. The Jews were offended by this. But He wasn’t
    speaking in material terms, He tells us Himself that it is the spirit that
    gives life, the flesh profits nothing (v. 63).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Sincere Explanation</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When Jesus spoke about birth, Nicodemus took Him literally, Jesus replied
    in John 3:5,6. “Except a man be born of water (physical birth) and of the
    spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the
    flesh (physical birth) is flesh.” Our Lord was saying, “Nicodemus, please
    don’t major on the physical and the material” – he was talking in spiritual
    terms.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Two parents create this new birth – the spirit of God and the Word of God,
    according to James 1:18 and 1Pet. 1:23. We are born again by the word of
    God, the living Word of God. The Spirit of God takes the Word of God and
    reveals the Son of God. And when you trust Jesus Christ as your Saviour, a
    miracle takes place in your heart – regeneration, you are born again. The
    two “spiritual parents” who accomplish this birth are the Spirit of God and
    the Word of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    New birth is a reality, the term is simple. But the great question is “who
    needs to be born again?” The Bible makes us to understand that all need
    this experience without exception (John 3:3, 7, Rom. 3:24, 25). Do you have
    this unique experience?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Write out the verses where the word “birth” appears in John3:1-9.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What is your own experience of new birth?

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The subject of new birth is crucial and essential, the better understanding
    a believer in Christ has, the more stable life he lives. Just as natural
    birth is a reality, the spiritual birth is equally a reality.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In John 3, Jesus talked about this issue of new birth with a religious
    leader by the name Nicodemus. This man knew his Old Testament, and he had
    heard a lot about what Jesus was saying and doing out of curiosity, he
    visited Jesus one night. Jesus told Nicodemus “…unless one is born again,
    he cannot see the Kingdom of God.” The explanation of Jesus is clear
    enough. And this should be our focus in teaching this lesson.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This lesson is a continuation of Lesson 9. It is aimed at two other
    important points on new birth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Dignity of the New Birth</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the last lesson, we considered the reality of the New Birth and the
    simplicity of the New Birth. A third fact comes to our attention – the
    dignity of the New Birth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>What New Birth Implies</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word translated “born again” can be translated “born from above”. We
    are born children of the King; children of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
    God, even to them that believed on his name” (John 1:12). “Behold, what
    manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called
    the sons (children) of God.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (1John 3:1) The dignity of the new birth is an amazing experience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Value of this Experience</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Children like to be proud of their parents. If we have a relative who is
    somebody important, we like to talk about it. We become name – droppers,
    you and I share the dignity of the new birth; we are the children of God –
    the God who created the universe, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
    Christ. We are in His family, we share His nature. I have the nature of my
    parents, and my children have my nature. We have God’s nature within
    because we have been born from above, and this new nature creates a new
    disposition.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Urgency of the New Birth</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Finally, let’s discuss the urgency of the new birth
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>New Birth is Commanded</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus said, “Ye must be born again” (John 3:7). It is not a suggestion, it
    is a commandment. It is not an idea that we can toy with; it is absolutely
    urgent –we must be born again. The new birth is instantaneous, it is not a
    process. There may be a process of preparation, you must have a desire to
    know God or a concern about getting rid of sin. But the birth itself is
    instantaneous, supernatural and permanent.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>New Birth is a Permanent Supernatural Birth.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Once you are born, you can’t be unborn. You may be disobedient, you may not
    grow as you should, but you cannot be unborn. You continue to remain a
    child of God, except you become a “reprobate” 2Cor.13:5.{O-KJV}; Rev.3:5.
    Our spiritual birth is a permanent supernatural birth, and there is urgency
    to it. “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God” (John
    3:3). The god of this world blinds those who believe not. Until you are
    born again, you cannot see what you are missing, you cannot see what you
    really are; you cannot see all that God has for you. You must be born
    again, not only to see the Kingdom of God, but to also enter the Kingdom of
    God. “Except a man be born of water (physical birth) and of the Spirit, he
    cannot enter into the Kingdom of God” (John 3:5).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Do you have this experience called new birth? Has God been talking to you?
    The reality of the new birth is that you can change; God will change you
    when you trust Christ. The simplicity of the new birth is that it is not
    through religion or good works but through trusting the Saviour. Imagine
    becoming a child of God and enjoying the dignity of the new birth. The
    urgency of the new birth is that you must be born again. If God has been
    talking to you about this, then open your heart now to Jesus Christ.

<p class="article"> 
    The focus of this third part on new birth is justification.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    How can a man be just before God? Justification is one of the key words in
    the Christian life. The key verse is Romans 5:1 “Therefore being justified
    by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”. We want to
    consider justification from three different angles: The meaning of
    justification, the method of justification and the marks of justification.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Meaning of Justification </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A. Definition: Justification is the gracious act of God in declaring
    righteous a sinner who believes in Jesus Christ. You should memorize this
    definition because it is important.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. <strong>Justification is an Act</strong>.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Notice, please, that justification is an act, not a process. No one
    Christian is more justified than any other Christian. If you are saved and
    your sister is saved, your sister and you are justified in the same way,
    and you have the same righteousness. Instantly, the believer is given a
    righteous standing before God. It is the gracious act of God, it is not
    something that men do.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. <strong>Justification is Unchanging</strong>.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Once God has declared that we are righteous through Jesus Christ, the sin
    question is settled once and for all.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Justification means not only that God forgets our sins – past, present and
    future – but justification means that God forgets we were sinners. He never
    again treats us as sinners.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Method of Justification</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    What is the method of justification? How can a holy God justify sinners?
    How can a holy God, as it were, overlook sin; God deals with it. There are
    four phrases you want to mark in your Bible in the book of Romans, and
    these four phrases explain to us the method of justification.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Freely by His Grace</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Romans 3:24 says, “Being justified freely by his grace.” How is God able to
    justify us? He justifies us by grace, not by merit. The word “freely” is
    translated “without a cause” in John 15:25. We are “justified without a
    cause by his grace.” There is nothing in us that makes God want to justify
    us. Justification is purely an act of God’s grace. Grace means favour that
    is not deserved and cannot be earned.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>By Faith</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Romans 3:28 says, “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
    without (apart from) the deeds of the law.” Not only are we justified by
    grace but we are justified by faith. Whenever you have grace, you have to
    have faith. Whenever you have law, you have to have works. A person cannot
    be justified by keeping the Law (see Romans 3:20).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are justified by faith – faith in Christ, faith that comes from the
    heart.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>By His Blood</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Romans 5:9 says, “Much more then, being now justified by his blood.” Not
    only are we justified by grace and faith, but we are justified by His
    blood. Somebody has to pay the price for sin. In order for God to justify
    the ungodly, He has to deal with their ungodliness. In order for us to be
    justified by faith, there has to be a Saviour for us to believe in. We are
    justified by His blood.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>Unto Life</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Finally, Romans 5:18 says, “Therefore as by the offence of one (Adam)
    judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of
    one (Jesus Christ) the free gift came upon all men unto justification of
    life.” That is a marvelous phrase - justification which results in life. We
    are justified unto life. Justification results in a new standing and a new
    life. That new life is the result of regeneration.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Marks of Justification</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Now, we want to look at the marks of justification, and our key passage is
    Romans 5:1-5.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The marks of justification in the believer’s life are revealed in
    relationships. If you are truly justified by faith, then you are going to
    have a right relationship with God (vs 1-2), a right relationship to
    circumstances (vs 3-4) and a right relationship to other people (v. 5).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Wow! It is a marvelous thing to be justified. If you have been justified,
    you have a right relationship with God; you have peace with God, not war,
    you have access to God; you have grace from God, and you can get through
    life with all His power; you can rejoice in the hope of that glory of God.

        We believe that people who have been born again grow in

        system of the world and embrace and live according to the values of the
        kingdom that Jesus proclaimed. As they do so, they increase in

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Solemn Call to Sanctification. 1 Thess.4:1-4</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    To sanctify is to make holy. It is to separate from the world and its
    worldly values to adopt the godly lifestyle of thoughts and actions. The
    journey to sanctification begins with the born again experience – the
    recognition and acceptance of Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Saviour
    (Jn.3:1-6, 16-18; Rom.10:9-11). Salvation rightly positions the believer
    for sanctification. The call to sanctification is a solemn call – requiring
    serious and sincere response from believers. The import of the call stems
    from the fact that sanctification which is closely associated with holiness
    is demanded in walking with and working for God who is absolutely holy.
    Armed with the assured promises of God to believers, the individual
    Christian is to cleanse, free and release self from the filthiness and
    pollution which comes with living in a depraved world – 2 Cor.7:1. God
    demands the sanctification of our entire being – spirit, soul and body (1
    Thess.5:23) because these must be preserved blameless in readiness for the
    coming of Christ. Acceptable service to God demands the release of our
    whole being – Deut. 6:5; Rom. 12:1,2. Sanctification is a call for
    believers to grow and mature from the foundational and fundamentals of
    Christian faith to perfection (Heb.6:1). We all need to be perfected in
    Christ’s image as a proof of our spiritual maturity and preparation for His
    coming.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Source of Sanctification</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sanctification is an activity of the divine. As a spiritual experience, it
    is available only to those who are connected with God. The goal of
    sanctification is separation of the saints from the secular and sinful, and
    setting them apart for the sacred purpose – Ex.13:1,2; 40:9-13. The
    sanctified are those consecrated to be holy, and their being so sanctified
    is intended not only to remind them of the necessity of spiritual cleansing
    but also of the gracious purpose of God to readily and genuinely accomplish
    the work of Christian’s utmost service - 2 Tim.2:19-21. Thus,
    sanctification graciously places the believer in the position of him or her
    being used honorably, gloriously and rewardingly in the pursuit of God’s
    agenda for the individual, and humanity as a whole.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If sanctification is understood in the sense of consecration and has to do
    with the way in which holiness is necessary for earthly people, or things
    to relate to the holy God, it is only reasonable and logical for us to
    accept that the means of obtaining this experience can only be the one
    provided by God who is holy, pure and righteous.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Primarily and intrinsically, sanctification derives from God. Consecration
    requires a special act of God to make a person or thing holy. God is the
    Sanctifier (1 Thess.5:23), sanctifying the full component of man for His
    eternal purpose. Sanctification occurs as a consequence of movement towards
    the Holy One.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word – pure and sincere word of God is also the source of
    sanctification – Jn.17:17-19. Separation from, or laying aside profane
    tendencies and panting for the word of God positions the believer for
    sanctification – 1 Pet.2:1,2; Eph.5:26; 1 Tim.4:15.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are also sanctified through the agency of the Holy Spirit – Rom.15:16; 1
    Pet.1:2. By the Spirit, we are made a new creature – 2 Cor.5:17. Jesus
    Christ also accomplishes sanctification for the believer, even as God has
    made Him unto us sanctification – 1 Cor.1:30. Through His precious blood
    shed on the cross, sanctification was offered to the believer – Heb.10:10;
    13:12.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Signs and Sustenance of Sanctified Experience</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sanctification is the will of God for His church. It is the path the
    believer must walk in order to please God and abound in spiritual service –
    1 Thess.4:1-7. The believer in Christ is called to a life akin to that of a
    disciplined soldier, a law-abiding, focused athlete and a tenacious,
    hopeful husbandman or farmer (2 Tim.2:3-6). If these must attain to their
    goals, then, great effort is required on their part. For the Christian
    pilgrim, sanctification is a “can’t-do-without”, they must-have antecedent
    to run the race well and successfully. God has not left man with the choice
    of whether to live the sanctified life or not as a means to please Him.
    There is the imperative call to all believers who anticipate the second
    coming of Christ to imbibe the sanctified experience –Titus 2:11-15. Since
    as believers we must necessarily put on the garment of sanctification, what
    are the checklists in our lives (the signs to watch out for) to prove that
    we are on the right track?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Not walking as other Gentiles walk – Eph.4:17-20; Rom.8:5,6
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Putting off the old man – Eph.4:22
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Not indulging in self-exaltation but displaying love and humility –
    Rom.12:3,10
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Renewing our spirit and mind – Eph.4:23; Rom.12:2
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Promoting unity and co-operation – Rom.12:4
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Putting on the new man – Eph.4:24
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Maintaining conscientious deployment of spiritual gifts – Rom.12:5-8
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Speaking the truth and speaking to edify – Eph.4:25,29
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Shunning evil and doing good – Rom.12:9
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The sanctified experience is that which ought to be kept by every believer
    until the day of Jesus Christ. Sanctification prepares and preserves the
    believer for the coming of Christ in glory – 1 Thess.5:23. God shines His
    light on the path of the righteous and it is a continuous, progressive walk
    in sanctification that keeps our spiritual life intact and perfected –
    Prov.4:18. Spiritual highway of sanctification and holiness is the path God
    requires from those who will walk in His steps – Isa.35:8.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sanctification involves separation from that which is unholy, profane and
    worldly and consecration to that which is pure, holy and godly. Man must
    consciously co-operate with God to effect this. The Christian life is not
    one to be locked up in a box and hidden somewhere. On the contrary, the
    Christian life is to be on constant display for others to see –
    Matt.5:14-16. People of the world are not ready to read the Bible
    theoretically but are more interested and eagerly waiting for Christians to
    live out the content of the Bible practically. In essence, what catches the
    world’s attention is more of what we do than what we say, preach or teach.
    It is time for practical Christianity!. What will promote this brand of
    life which the world eagerly wants and waits to see through us (Christians)
    is the sanctified experience. A life of sanctification is a catalyst for
    the promotion of the Gospel and advancing the second coming of Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God will never demand from us beyond that which we can give. All the people
    that God has ever called – Moses, Aaron, Paul etc. and used for His glory,
    sanctification was the hallmark of their lives. Jesus Christ is also the
    one sanctified by the Father and sent into the world (Jn. 10:36) to execute
    God’s mission. As disciples of Jesus Christ, if we are to continue that
    mission and do it creditably (Jn. 14:12; 15:16), we too must be sanctified.
    That is, we must be brought into that intimate relationship enjoyed by the
    Father and Son. God’s standard has not changed – He is looking for
    sanctified vessels that are meet for the Master’s use and prepared unto
    every good work – 2 Tim.2:19-21. The presence of the Holy Spirit is the key
    to experiential reality of sanctification. We must constantly live in total
    surrender to God and be humble to invite the grace of sanctification to be
    displayed in our lives at all times so that we can fulfil His mission on
    earth.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All Christians have been called to sanctification. The level of growth in
    sanctification experience differs from one Christian to another. We are
    enjoined to provoke one another to love and do good work. Sanctification is
    a good work God wants to accomplish in the life of all believers. As
    individual Christians, when we daily live the life of Christ before the
    rest of the world, we are invariably projecting the sanctifying power of
    Jesus Christ – the power that keeps believers above sin, Satan, flesh and
    its allures. We must realize that it is the sanctification experience that
    will keep our garments spotless until the appearing of our Lord and
    Saviour, Jesus Christ.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Love and Faith Explained</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The scriptures describe and present love and faith as attributes of God.
    These two virtues are necessary in Christian’s walk with God and work for
    God. Love and faith are not abstract elements but are indeed real, cogent
    and demonstrable – Jn.13:1; Heb.11:1,8-10. As human beings, we derive our
    conceptions of God from the special revelation which He has given of
    Himself and one of the clear images presented to us is the fact that God is
    love – 1 Jn.4:8,16. The love of God is strongly declared to us as that of
    His existence. Love is the highest characteristic of God, the one attribute
    in which other characteristics of God reflect graciously. Love, whether
    human or divine, is the deepest possible expression of the personality and
    of the closeness of personal relations. Love is rooted firmly in the
    personal character of God Himself and is the basis of the divine covenant
    He made with Israel and all of God’s people. The covenant relationship
    between Israel and God was premised upon God Himself, who took the
    initiative and chose Israel because He loved her (Deut.4:37; 7:7,8;
    Isa.43:4).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The marks of love (listed in 1 Cor.13:4-8) is the pattern by which the
    Christian life is to be marked as true image and ambassadors of God. Love
    for God and for fellow human being is to be the motive for our actions
    (Matt.25:34-40), and the reward of faith is the end of those actions
    (Heb.11:39,40). True and genuine love, when expressed towards God and
    humans places us above the law for all the laws are summed up in love
    (Rom.13:8-10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    With respect to faith, the Old and New Testaments present faith as a
    positive and prominent attitude of God and which God expects to find in all
    who relate with Him (Heb.11:3,6). The word “faith” is also expressed in
    such terms as believe, trust or hope. Faith is trusting in God, in the
    Person of Christ and in the Word. Faith is one of the fruits of the Spirit
    (Gal.5:22) and it is the typical attitude expected of Christians. Faith has
    its rewards both for now and in the future. Faith endears us to God and
    empowers us for relevance in God’s service and kingdom. It is the key by
    which we access the presence and provisions of God including salvation,
    healing, peace, joy and other breakthroughs. Love and faith are two
    attitudes compelling for the Christians. To be deficient of these is to
    miss the great spiritual and material blessings.

    The Scriptures is united as to the relationship between love and faith.
    Love and faith as attitudes of the Christian life are to be practiced side
    by side in the journey of this life and that which looks towards eternity.
    Like Siamese twins, the Christian life is to be lived concurrently by love
    and faith in order to bring about a glorious end.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In several passages of the Scriptures, God enjoins the practice of love and
    faith as strong and necessary pillars for Christianity. What should
    predispose the Christian to embrace these attitudes?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø The realization of the fact that we are children of light and that the
    second coming of the Lord is a reality that should be expected and prepared
    for – 1 Thess.5:8.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø Walking in love and faith renders observance of ceremonial law
    unnecessary – Gal.5:6.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø It is the character demanded of Christians – 1 Tim.1:5.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ø It is the proof of abiding life in Christ – 1 Jn.3:23.

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Love and Faith Exemplified</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Faith works by love. We display our faith in God through love. When we show
    love, we are proving that we have faith in God. Love and faith are two
    catalysts that are essential to faithful Christian living. We see examples
    of this practice in the Scripture.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>i) Love – God’s Example.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is love – 1 Jn.4:7. Love is God’s greatest attribute. He made us in His
    image so that we can manifest His perfect reflection. How did God give
    expression to love?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - In bringing Israel out of bondage in Egypt – Deut.7:8. God kept the oath
    He made with Israel’s forefathers by redeeming them out of the hands of
    their oppressors – Ps.105. God also demonstrated His love by sending His
    only Begotten Son (Jesus Christ) to die for mankind – Jn.3:16; Rom.5:8. God
    extends His love to us in showing us mercy and quickening us with Christ –
    Eph.2:4,5. God also bestows on believers the privilege of sonship – being
    called sons of God – 1 Jn.3:1; 4:9,10. Our Heavenly Father equally freely
    gives the blessings of nature to all, irrespective of individual
    relationship to Him – Matthew 5:45.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>ii.) Love – Jesus Christ’s Example</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus Christ is love personified. Christ’s self-sacrificing commitment to
    us is seen in him laying down his life – Jn.15:13. Christ shares divine
    nature with God, the Father, one of which is love. This token of love was
    extended to His disciples – Jn.13:1; 15:9.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>iii.) Love – The Christian’s Duty</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Christian is encouraged to love with the entire being – Deut.6:5; 10:12
    because God will not accept half-hearted devotion to love. He is to remain
    (abide) in love while anticipating the coming of Jesus Christ – Jude 21.
    When Christians walk in love, it is a proof of discipleship – Jn.13:35. The
    Christian, in loving one another, is the standard Christ has prescribed for
    His church – Matt.22:39; Jn.15:22. Sincerity is also demanded in the
    display of love – Rom.12:9.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Faith</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Christian walk is a walk of faith. The Christian journey begins with
    faith and must be continued in faith until the entry into eternal life.
    This faith comes by hearing – the hearing of the Word of God – Rom.10:17.
    Whatever is not of faith tends to sin – Rom.14:23. The disciples of Christ
    recognized the need for them to grow in faith – Lk.17:5. Growing in faith
    is synonymous with spiritual progress, which every Christian must desire
    and cultivate.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Obedience is better than sacrifice – 1 Sam.15:22. We are blessed and we
    avoid unnecessary pains of life when we walk with God in obedience. Hosea
    6:6 says,
    <em>
        “For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more
        than burnt offerings.”
    </em>
    God is more interested in our living a life marked by love and faith as a
    right response to His demands, rather than our offering of useless
    sacrifices. Obedience to follow God’s instruction will ensure that we eat
    the good of the land – Isa.1:19. This is talking about the blessings of now
    and hereafter. As God’s children, God has shown us what is good and what He
    requires of us. It is for us to do that which is just, love mercy, and walk
    humbly with Him – Mic.6:8.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This is a call to a walk of love and faith. As we walk with God and relate
    with others around us, it must be done in the atmosphere of love and faith.
    Remember the admonition of Beloved John (1 Jn.3:14-
    <em>
        18 “<strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>We know that we have passed from
        death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his
        brother abideth in death. <strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Whosoever
        hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath
        eternal life abiding in him. <strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>Hereby
        perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and
we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.        <strong><sup>17 </sup></strong>But whoso hath this world's good, and
        seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion
from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?        <strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>My little children, let us not love in
        word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.”
    </em>
    Love works no ill (evil) to his neighbour because love is the fulfilling of
    the law. The pure religion and the undefiled life God requires from us as
    Christians is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to
    keep ourselves unspotted from the world. When we constantly fix our eyes on
    the glorious hope – the hope of the appearing of the great God and our
    Saviour, Jesus Christ, we would be motivated to reject all that is opposed
    to a life of love and faith. Jesus Christ taught His disciples to pray: Thy
    kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven (Matt.6:10).
    Love and faith are two great virtues God wants enforced in the earth so as
    to hasten the coming of His kingdom. As Christians, we are to spread the
    message and manner of love and faith to our present generation.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Christian is under obligation to radiate
    <s>
        to
    </s>
    love and faith in the practice of his belief. A life lacking in these is
    not what Christ lived and died for. A natural person cannot satisfy God’s
    righteous standard. Therefore, the help and assistance of the Holy Spirit
    must be sought and harnessed. The Holy Spirit is the Chief Enabler and
    Enhancer of a life filled with love and faith. If we agree that love and
    faith are gifts of the Spirit, it necessarily means that it is only the
    life saturated in the Spirit can produce these graces. One of the reasons
    we render services to God and to fellow man is the expectation of reward.
    Indeed, there is nothing wrong or out of place for us to expect reward for
    what we do because the gracious God has already assured us about this in
    His word (1 Cor.15:58). We must however note that the basis of God’s reward
    for service rendered is motivated by love and faith (1 Cor.13:1-3). What
    drives your passion for the work you are doing for God and others? It
    should be love and faith if it is to receive God’s compensation. Let us
    clothe ourselves in humility, love and faith as Christ did (Phil.2:5-11) so
    that we can gloriously complete our race here on earth.
