    Lesson Introduction:
</h5>
<h5>
    <em>
        We believe that it is essential for all believers to join with and
        become part of a congregation of other believers. It is important to
        worship together, observe the ordinances of the church, encourage and
        support one another, and work together to advance the Lord’s kingdom
        (Hebrews 10:24, 25).

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Membership of The Church: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Definition Of Church</strong>
    :
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    According to the dictionary, a Church is “the whole body of Christians” (1
    Cor. 12:12). The Church is a congregation of people who believe in Jesus as
    Lord and Saviour. Founded in Matthew 16:13-18 but came into physical
    manifestation in the Acts of the Apostles after Jesus was taken up to
    heaven. The Church lives in obedience to the Word of God and worships God
    in Spirit and truth. The Church is either invisible or visible. The
    Invisible Church is the universal body of Christ of which we become part of
    from the time of getting born again. However, the Visible Church is a local
    assembly where believers gather together for worship and manifests as
    denominations under different names. It is possible to be a card carrying
    member of a denomination and not be a part of the universal body of Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Defence for Church Membership</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Scripturally, the criteria for membership of the invisible or visible
    Church is found in John 6:28-29. The primary criteria is salvation and not
    abilities or the services we are able to render in the Church. Becoming a
    member instead of casual attendance at church services is of immense
    benefit to all believers (Ephesians 2:19). Church membership is akin to
    blocks that are brought together to form a building. It is very easy for an
    idle block that is not cemented to the wall of a building to be stolen or
    destroyed. However, once cemented into the wall, it becomes increasingly
    more difficult for the block to be taken away. Belonging and getting
    involved in a local church is for the personal security of individual
    believers in addition to other benefits that accrue from the relationships
    that are built in the Church. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Mode of Church Relationships </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Church as part of her discipleship agenda should encourage people to
    grow until they become matured to the point of service (Acts 14:21-23).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Meeting Intents</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Stronger bonds are established as believers interact in worship services,
    midweek and house fellowship meetings (Acts 2:46), through inter-church and
    inter-city Church relationships (Acts 9:31) and leadership accountability
    interactions (Acts 20:17-20, 28). These interactions recorded in the bible
    form the biblical basis for house fellowship, membership meetings, workers’
    meetings and leaders’ meetings etc. in the Foursquare organization. Instead
    of being overly critical and/or deviant about these meetings, it would be
    expedient that everyone works at exploring ways of making the meetings more
    productive for the benefit of the church. In one way or the other, these
    meetings help to strengthen individual believers, deepen the knowledge of
    God, and provide comfort in addition to synergy building and strategy
    development.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Mixed Generations &amp; Cultures </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is vital that Church relationships transcend tribe, language and cut
    across generational divides. God operates a trans-generational agenda. He
    is the “God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” This is the reason Psalm 71:18
    declares, “Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I
    declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to
    come.” The old and young generations within our churches all have clear
    roles to play in ensuring the fulfillment of the scripture, “One generation
    shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts”
    (Psalm 145:4). The Church should build synergies across generational and
    cultural lines to promote unity and advancement of the gospel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Mandate on Church Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This mandate includes fellowshipping with Jesus and being sent forth to
    preach (Mark 3:14).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A. <strong>Reliance on God</strong>: The church has a clear mandate to
    relate with God from whom strength, grace and victory come since without
    Him, we can do nothing (John 15:5). The Church in Antioch had men who had
    lived in the king’s palace and those that had the grace of prophets and
    teachers, yet, they took time to fast and pray to God (Acts 13:1-3). It was
    during this time that the Lord spoke to them to separate Barnabas and Saul
    for the work of ministry. It is important that our leaders and followers
    rely on God for His leading and direction before appointing people that
    will lead church planting teams and other assignments within the Church
    instead of relying on mere physical endowments.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    B. <strong>Relationship with Unbelievers</strong>: The Church also has a
    clear mandate to relate with unbelievers in a manner that they remain
    unspotted while pulling them out of the fire (Jude 22-23) into a
    relationship with Jesus (Eph. 2:12-13). Adequate care must therefore be
    taken by the Church to nurture relationships in a manner that keeps our
    light aglow so we can remain relevant to the world at all times (Matt.
    5:16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Church of God is a single, indivisible, indestructible universal body
    of believers that the Lord unleashed as an agency to carry out His work on
    earth. The Lord wants believers everywhere to build a solid network of
    relationships that cut across denominational, language, cultural and
    generational divides. Discovering the biblical basis, various meetings and
    practices in the Church will help to enrich and grow our commitment and
    dedication.

    1. What is the difference between being a member of a local Church and

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Before teaching this lesson, make sure you understand clearly what the
    Church means and the difference(s) between local Church membership and
    being part of the universal body of Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    You will also need to be abreast with the roles the Church is called to
    play on daily basis with respect to God, the body of believers and those
    who are yet to embrace the gospel as well as the nature of relationships
    the Church should cultivate in order to deliver on these fundamental
    responsibilities.

    <em>
        We believe that it is essential for all believers to join with and
        become part of a congregation of other believers. It is important to
        worship together, observe the ordinances of the church, encourage and
        support one another, and work together to advance the Lord’s kingdom
        (Hebrews 10:24, 25).

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Commitment &amp; Continuity: v 41, 42, 46a; Acts 10:47</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Thousands of people who gladly received the word stayed committed to Jesus
    Christ and were added unto them (Acts 2:41). “Them” means the Church (body
    of believers). It is not enough to be identified with Christianity without
    maintaining fellowship with other believers.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>Basis for Continuity</strong>
    : Notice the emphasis on continuing steadfastly (Acts 2:42) and “continuing
    daily with one accord” (vs. 46). It was not enough that they heard,
    believed and confessed Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. We are called not
    to be hearers only but doers of those things that we learn from studying
    the Bible individually or hear through the preaching of God’s Word (James
    1:22-24). The practice of Christianity is a present continuous exercise.
    After believing, it is important that we endure to the end so as to be
    saved (Matthew 24:13). Things we should continue to do include water
    baptism (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38), doctrinal beliefs (2 Tim.
    3:16), fellowship (Heb. 10:25), breaking of bread (2 Cor. 11:24-25), and
    other spiritual exercises like obedience (Romans 6:16), worship (John
    4:24), bible study (2 Tim 2:15), soul winning (Matt. 28:19-20), prayer and
    fasting (Acts 13:3). These practices are pointers to the fact that the
    believer can do nothing except he abides in Jesus Christ who is the Vine
    (John 15:4-6). The Church must get deep in the act of discipleship to help
    people who visit our churches to be retained or continue in the worship of
    God in the company of other believers (the Church).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of Church Membership</strong>
    : To individual believers, it include edification, exhortation, comfort,
    show of love (1 Cor. 14:3; Heb. 10:25) through fellowship with one another.
    In addition, relationships in the Church promotes intimacy (Acts 2:44-45),
    membership accountability (2 Thess. 3:7-9), welfare for the needy (Acts
    4:34-37; 9:36-39; Rom. 12:13) and support during special events e.g. child
    birth, anniversaries, illness etc. (1 Tim 5:10; 6:18; Gal. 6:10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Commonality &amp; Cooperation - v 44, 45, 46</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is essential that everyone who comes in contact with the Church realizes
    the oneness and unity of the body. Every believer retains his or her
    individuality but becomes baptized into one body – the church – at
    conversion (1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:4). There is beauty and pleasantness in
    unity (Psalm 133:1-3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>Working Together</strong>
    : Christians are supposed to come together, work together, break bread
    together, pray together, witness together, do things together and operate
    with singleness of heart. Believers should be lowly in mind instead of
    self-aggrandizement, strife and vainglory (Philip 2:3). The church is a
    place where there is neither Greek nor Jew, bond nor free, male nor female,
    circumcision nor un-circumcision, for all are one in Christ (Rom. 2:10; 1
    Cor. 12:13; Col. 3:11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>Caring &amp; Sharing</strong>
    : There are lazy and selfish people in today’s church as much as there were
    in the early church. Yet, the early church connected with those in need by
    selling their possessions to take care of those in need. Practical
    demonstration of this unity include wealth sharing (Acts 2:46). This is a
    real challenge for today’s church. It is a welcome development that a lot
    of our churches are getting more focused on care and welfare as a means of
    reaching out to the unsaved. In doing so, the practice of welfare is
    becoming so regimented and regulated. The picture of love and care is
    painted of the Church, yet, individual members of the Church are so far
    from the act of love. It is expedient the Church goes beyond the corporate
    exhibition of welfare to teaching and encouraging individual believers to
    learn the act of loving and caring for one another. This would be far more
    impactful.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Commission of the Church - v 43, 47, Acts 13:1-3; 15:22</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Church from the above passages of scripture is commissioned for the
    following:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>Signs &amp; Wonders</strong>
    : Signs and wonders are important proof of our faith in God (Acts 2:43;
    Mark 16:17-18). It is meant to be a tool that will help men to fear (dread,
    respect, submit) God (Hebrews 12:28-29). The Lord shows up with proof of
    His power to unbelievers and demonstrates love. There is no doubt that
    miracles are one of the things that authenticate the Bible. The Church
    should therefore not shy away from signs and wonders but earnestly pray to
    God for great manifestations of His power to bring about the healing of
    incurable diseases, opening of blind eyes and deaf ears etc.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>Praise God</strong>
    : The Church must not be deficient in the act of praise-giving to God (v
    47). Appropriate focus must be placed on the act of worship because God
    inhabits the praises of His people (Psalm 22:3). This implies that as we
    praise God, we create the atmosphere in which God loves to dwell. When we
    praise Him with all our hearts, He comes into our praises and activates
    miracles. The Church should be careful to make the Lord the center of
    attraction or focus in her acts of worship. The focus should be removed
    from men, no matter how powerful or endowed, because no man can do anything
    except it be given him/her by God. Indeed, all power belongs to God (Matt.
    28:18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>c. </strong>
    <strong>Attract Favour: </strong>
    The Church is meant to attract favour, not repel favour (Acts 2:47b).
    Recollect how the children of Israel attracted favour and spoilt the
    Egyptians (Exodus 12:26). When the favour of the Lord comes upon the
    Church, the enemies of the Church will become weakened in their capacity to
    fight against the Church.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>d. </strong>
    <strong>Soul Winning</strong>
    : The act of evangelism and discipleship becoming increasingly more
    unpopular in today’s Church whereas, that was what drove growth in the
    early Church (Acts 2:47c). The Lord added to the Church as every believer
    following Peter’s preaching caught the fire and began spreading the gospel
    in residential neighborhoods, work places, king’s palaces and everywhere
    they went. This was the reason fear came upon every soul. Prayer and
    fasting meetings were called to seek the face of the Lord for laborers to
    be sent into the harvest field (Acts 13:1-3; Matt. 9:38; Luke 10:2).
    Through the acts of evangelism, the indestructible Church of God will
    continue to multiply (Acts 9:31) and scale all odds (Acts 20:19-20). It is
    the responsibility of Church Leaders to lead initiatives that will drive
    commitment to evangelism and the growth of the Church (Acts 15:22).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Church was equipped with all that is needed to make her succeed. All
    believers should commit themselves to become responsible members of the
    Church so as to experience the realization of the full potential that God

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Christians are blessed to be citizens of a heavenly kingdom; our
    citizenship is in heaven – Philippians 3:20. We have been conveyed into the
    kingdom of God's dear Son, and as such, we are described as "sojourners and
    pilgrims" in this world - 1Pe 2:11. As "pilgrims", we live and work under
    the governments of men... with a variety of political systems: democracies,
    kingdoms, dictatorships, etc. offering varying degrees of freedom,
    responsibilities etc. What is our duty to such governments? The Christian
    church and organization began and thrived during the Roman Empire, to
    Christians in the capital city of Rome Paul wrote of their responsibility,
    to Christians dispersed in outlying areas of the Empire, Peter did also,
    the Christian's duty to government is made very clear by the apostles.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Biblical Rules Of Obedience To Civil Government</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Apostle Paul stressed these twice "Let every soul be subject to the
    governing authorities" - Rom 13:1 "Therefore you must be subject..." - Ro
    13:5! Peter likewise taught this duty - 1Pe 2:13-14- "Therefore submit
    yourselves..."! Submit here means "be subject to" signifying "to place
    one's self under subjection; to render one's self subordinate".
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to submit "to every ordinance of man", not to a particular law
    passed by government, but to the civil government or institution itself,
    that we are to submit to every human institution (whether it be a monarchy,
    democracy, totalitarian state, etc.) -- Our responsibility is clear: "Let
    every soul be subject" – Rom. 13:1
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to pay taxes: as an act of submission we should pay our taxes - Ro
    13:6 and other fees that are due, such as customs - Ro 13:7. We may not
    approve of how the taxes are spent, but I doubt the early Christians
    approved of how Nero spent the government's money either.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to respect whom respect is due - Rom 13:7, such as police officers,
    judges, and if you do evil, be afraid! - Ro 13:4, honor to whom honor is
    due - Ro 13:7; cf. 1Pe 2:17, such as presidents, kings, governors, local
    leaders, out of respect for the office, if not for the man (or woman) our
    duty is not limited to those whose political or personal behavior we
    approve.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For Kings and all in authority, we are to offer supplications, prayers,
    intercessions - 1Ti 2:1-2, praying for those who lead, not only our
    country, but those around the world, praying that they rule with wisdom,
    righteousness, and mercy.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are to offer thanks - 1Ti 2:1-2, taking time to thank God for those who
    rule well, thanking God for when we live in peace and prosperity, and for
    protecting us when we do not. Invaluable contributions Christians can give
    their country are their prayers.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Reasons For Obedience To Civil Government</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    That we might lead good lives; good in a material sense, to enjoy quiet and
    peaceful times- 1Th 4:11; He 12:14a; good in a spiritual sense, free to be
    godly and reverent - He 12:14b. As God works through the governments of men
    to bestow peace, prayer should be a priority for those who wish to live in
    peace.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Governing authorities that exist have been appointed by God! – Rom. 13:1,
    the book of Daniel 2:20-21; 4:17 emphasized that even those that are evil,
    which God often uses for His divine purposes and then replaces - cf. Exo.
    9:16 (Egypt); Isa 10:5-12 (Assyria)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Therefore to resist government means to resist God Himself! - Rom 13:2-4,
    to resist is to bring judgment upon one's self, for government is a
    minister of God, designed to avenge evil. Peter adds two good reasons - 1Pe
    2:15. First and foremost, "this is the will of God" also, "for the Lord's
    sake" - 1Pe 2:13.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This will suffice for all true servants of God, that we may "put to silence
    the ignorance of foolish men" because of their allegiance to a heavenly
    King, Christians are often falsely accused of sedition or treason - e.g.,
    Act 17:5-8, and by doing good (e.g., by submitting), we can "silence"
    ignorant charges, therefore to avoid wrath and have a good conscience, "you
    must be subject" - Rom 13:5.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>
        The Exceptions To The Rules Of Obedience To Civil Government
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    There are occasions on which Christians not only may, but must disobey the
    civil authorities, anytime a civil government requires a Christian to do
    what God forbids or forbids them to do what God commands, then the person
    must disobey.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is not whenever government is oppressive, consider the government and
    conditions when Paul and Peter wrote, the government was totalitarian,
    under Nero's evil and despotic rule as emperor, under his reign, Christians
    suffered greatly - 1 Peter 4:12-13; 5:8-9, Paul and Peter were eventually
    martyred.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The only exception: we must obey God rather than man! As illustrated by
    Peter and the apostles - Acts 4:18-20; 5: 27-29! When government tries to
    force us to disobey God, we must disobey the government, even then, we may
    break only the particular law designed to force disobedience to God, we
    have no authority to break other laws in protest to the unjust law, when
    government seeks to stifle our service to God, we must obey God rather than
    man!
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Every human government is accountable to God and is accountable to maintain
    its affairs with justice and with righteousness. When the government is no
    longer acting justly and no longer protecting life—sanctioning abortions,
    same sex marriages, for example—then it is the task of the church to be the
    prophetic voice, to call the state to task and tell the state to repent and
    do what God commands it to do.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    That government must assume some form, the administration cannot be left to
    chance, there must be a constitution, clearly defined, and generally known
    and approved. The first form of government was that of the family. But, as
    families multiplied, each having a variety of rights, out of which would
    emerge differences not to be easily settled, some more general form became
    necessary, Government by patriarchy having fallen through, many other forms
    are possible, and have become actual. Which then is the one ordained of
    God? This does not concern the apostle.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Why are civil laws necessary? How does Paul define failure to obey the
    civil laws of society? Romans 13:2-4
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What just punishment do law breakers deserve? See Romans 13:3-4
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. What two reasons does Paul give for obedience to the civil law? See
    Romans 13:5.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. What example does Paul give under civil law which Christians are obliged
    to be obedient to?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5. Can you think of three examples in the Gospel where Scripture supports
    obedience in paying taxes? - Luke 2:1-5, Matthew 17:24-27, 22:12-22; Mark
    12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26; 23:2
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    6. For what reason does Jesus tell His disciples they should pay the
    required tax in Matthew 17:27?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    7. Under what circumstances civil law would not be binding upon the
    conscience or actions of Christians? Matthew 22:18-22
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    8. Are Christians obliged to obey civil laws that are contrary to the Law
    of God?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    9. Ultimately, from who do civil authorities receive their authority and to
    whom are unjust rulers and judges answerable and how will they be judged?

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Those civil authorities who hold the responsibility for maintaining civil
    order and for providing just laws only serve according to God's pleasure.
    Therefore, Apostle Paul maintains, it is our responsibility as Christians
    to support and respect the civil authority and the laws enacted through
    them.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These civil authorities also we honor with our obedience. And we do so not
    only out of fear but out of love; not only for reasons of human convenience
    but because our conscience tells us to act in this way. The reason for this
    is based on the fact, as the Apostle says, “that all authority comes from
    God; therefore, one must give everyone what is his due."
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The government is made for the people, and not the people for the
    government. To the masses it matters little what form of government
    obtains, but it matters much indeed whether the government rules according
    to wise or unwise principles. Yet, after all, any government at all is
    better than none, and none is possible if no obedience is to be secured.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These duties are enforced on two grounds — that they are ordained of God,
    and therefore ought to be obeyed as a matter of conscience. This implies
    that it is according to God's purpose that society should be organized into
    self-governing communities for —
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (1) Protection against aggressions from without.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (2) For the restraint of wrong-doing and the promotion of prosperity
    within.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Introduction to the Holy Scriptures (Ecclesiastes 12:9-14)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Bible is commonly referred to as the Holy Book. It introduces God to
    us, tells us how to relate with Him and instructs us on godly living.
    Solomon's teaching in the book of Ecclesiastes, like other books in the
    Scripture, provides a guide and stimulus to godly living and a secure basis
    for living (Acts 26:14; Jer. 10:1-5). In Psalms 95:6-7, the concepts of
    Shepherd and Creator are combined as they are in Eccl. 12:1,11. Because of
    the peculiar value and authority of the words, Solomon warned his son and
    all his readers not to seek answers beyond those God had given through the
    wise/His word. If they would keep looking for answers in many other books,
    they would wear themselves out (Prov. 1:8,10,15; 2:1; 3:1,11,21; 4:10,20;
    5:1,20; 6:1,3,20; 7:1; 19:27; 23:15,19,26; 24:13,21; 27:11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Someone has said that life is like a school. God teaches us primarily from
    His Word; but He also teaches us through creation, history, and the various
    experiences of life. Solomon explained the characteristics of his own work
    as a teacher of God's truth. His teaching was also orderly (Eccl. 12:9).
    After studying a matter, he weighed his conclusions carefully, and then
    arranged them in an orderly fashion. He claimed that his words were
    inspired/given by God, the One Shepherd (Eccl. 12:11). Inspiration was the
    special miracle ministry of the Holy Spirit that enabled men of God to
    write the Word of God as God wanted it written, complete and without error
    (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures (II Tim.3:12-17)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Scriptures are true and dependable. "All Scripture is God breathed".
    That is, given by the inspiration of God. The doctrine of the inspiration
    of Scripture is vitally important, and a doctrine that Satan has attacked
    from the beginning (Gen. 3:1). The Holy Spirit of God used men of God to
    write the Word of God (2 Peter 1:20-21). The Spirit did not erase the
    natural characteristics of the writers. In fact, God in His providence
    prepared the writers for the task of writing the Scriptures. Each writer
    has his own distinctive style and vocabulary. Each book grew out of a
    special set of circumstances.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Biblical inspiration means the supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on
    the Bible's writers, which guaranteed that what they wrote was accurate and
    trustworthy. Revelation means the communicating of truth to man by God;
    inspiration has to do with the recording of this communication in a way
    that is dependable. Whatever the Bible says about itself, man, God, life,
    death, history, science, and every other subject is true. This does not
    mean that every statement in the Bible is true, because the Bible records
    the lies of men and of Satan. But the record is true.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Purpose of the Holy Scriptures (Psalm 19:1-11)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All of the Scriptures are God's witness to us of who He is, what He has
    said and done, and what He wants us to be and to do. The witness God bears
    of Himself in the written Word is sure and reliable. Through the Word, we
    become wise concerning salvation (2 Tim 3:15) and the principles of
    successful living (Prov. 2; 8:33; 10:8). The "simple" are the childlike
    people who humbly receive God's truth (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21-24). The
    statutes are God's detailed instructions concerning the practical matters
    of everyday life. The commandment of the Lord means “that which is
    appointed”. Because the Lord loves us, He commands us on what to do and
    warns us what not to do, and how we respond is a matter of life or death
    (Deut. 30:15-20). God's commands are pure and lead to a pure life, if we
    obey from the heart.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Bible is the Holy Scriptures (Rom. 1:2; 7:12; 2 Tim. 3:15), and
    therefore His Word is "very pure" (Ps. 119:140; Prov. 30:5). We are
    enlightened and learn God's truth when we obey what He says (John 7:17) and
    not just when we read it or study it (James 1:22-25). The Word of God is
    the road map to guide us (Ps. 119:19). Like a traveler on the highway, we
    need the divine guidance of God to reach our destination. To walk with God,
    we need to have reverence for Him. The fear of the Lord reminds us that we
    cannot learn the Word of God unless we show reverence and respect for the
    God of the Word. To teach the Bible is to teach the fear of the Lord (Ps.
    34:11; Deut. 4:9-10), and the mark of a true Bible student is a burning
    heart, not a big head (Luke 24:32; 1 Cor. 8:1). The fear of God is clean
    and maturing. We do not decay or deteriorate as we walk in the fear of the
    Lord (2 Cor. 4:16-18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Paul noted that the Scriptures are able to make one wise with regard to
    salvation, a lesson Timothy had learned long before. He pointed out that
    all Scripture is God-breathed, "inspired", that is, God's words were given
    through men superintended by the Holy Spirit so that their writings are
    without error. We must lay a good foundation for our children following
    Timothy’s example.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Then Paul asserted the "usefulness" of the Word. For each aspect of
    Timothy's ministry, whatever it might be - teaching (instructing believers
    in God's truths), rebuking those in sin (1 Tim 5:20; 2 Tim 4:2), correcting
    those in error (2 Tim 2:25; 4:2), and training (child-training) in
    righteousness (guiding new believers in God's ways) - for all of these and
    more, the written Word of God is profitable.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Through the word, the man of God (one who must provide spiritual leadership
    to others) must be "complete, capable, and proficient in the sense of being
    able to meet all demands." Paul added that he must be equipped (furnished)
    for every good work (2 Tim. 2:21). Like Timothy, we must have confidence in
    God's ability to supply all our needs through the Word.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It was important for all Christians to realize that persecution awaits
    everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ (John 15:18-21). Paul
    wrote that we could actually expect the situation to get worse and the
    pressure to intensify in the last days. False teachings would increase as
    evil men and impostors (charlatans) go from bad to worse, deceiving and
    being deceived. We must resist feeding on error.

<p class="article"> 
    In Psalms 19:7-9, David described the efficacious nature of the Law of the
    Lord. In the Old Testament, the Law was the dominant element in God's
    specific revelation. The perfect Law of God (flawless) can change people
    (Ps. 12:6; 18:30; Prov. 30:5). It revives the soul and the Law's statutes
    can be trusted to make one wise. The precepts of the Law give joy to the
    heart and its commands enlighten one's eyes, that is, brightens his life
    and guide him (Ps. 19:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The statutes of the Lord detailed instructions concerning the practical
    matters of everyday life. For the Old Testament Jew, the statutes related
    to what they ate, how they dressed, how they kept clean, and so forth. God
    laid down certain basic laws and commandments, and the statutes applied
    them to specific situations. The New Testament epistles give applications
    of these principles (Eph. 4:20-32).

        A man responded to a question on his hospital bed many years ago. He
        was asked whether he has family and if yes has any of his family
        members come to visit him in his predicament? He replied by saying that
        everyone has family but it depends on what one makes of his family.
        That was a truth driven home for serious consideration.

    Everyone belongs to a family and e

        anything, and be ready to go extra mile for a family member. In the
        same vein, we see friendship as the second most basic relationship in
        life. Jesus said that the two most important commandments are to love
        God with all your heart and love your neighbour as yourself. We often
        experience God's love through the love of a friend.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>What Is Love?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Love is the most important and pre-eminent virtue in the Christian walk
    because:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. God is love – I Jn.4:7-8
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. Love is the defining characteristic of who a true Christian is –
    Jn.13:35; I Cor.13:1-3
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c. It is the summation of all the laws and commandments of God –
    Matt.22:36-40
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In seeking to define love from the Christian perspective, the “All about
    God” website submits that love is not the ‘warm fuzzy feeling’ that
    characterizes the world’s definition of love, that one may not have that
    ‘warm fuzzy feeling’ for everyone that you meet, but that you must love
    everyone that comes your way. According to the author of this website, the
    Christian definition of love is found in the statement of our Lord Jesus
    Christ in Matt.7:12 - "Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do
    also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.” Love is pursuing the
    best interest of the other person in any given situation, whether or not it
    is convenient for you, and without necessarily expecting a reward or
    compensation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>What Is Loyalty?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Different online dictionaries define loyalty as: A strong feeling of
    support or allegiance, a sense of duty or of devoted attachment to someone
    or something. The synonyms of loyalty are: allegiance, faithfulness,
    fidelity, devotion, or bond. It has been noted that we live in a world
    where
    <a
        href="http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Being-Selfish"
        title="Stop Being Selfish"
    >
        selfishness
    </a>
    seems to be the rule of the day, and personal gain the objective of most
    relationships and endeavours. One of the most honorable character traits a
    person can develop is the ability to be loyal. Loyalty is the ability to
    put others before yourself, to stick with them through thick and thin, and
    to look out for them and pursue their best interest, even in their absence.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>
        How are love and loyalty demonstrated in family and friendship
        relationships (I Cor.13)?
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (Some of the points below relate more to family relationship, while some
    are common to both family and friendship relationships)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Love and loyalty are demonstrated in family and friendship relationships
    through:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. Pursuing things that are in the best interest of family and friends, at
    whatever personal costs, as Jonathan did to David – I Sam.19:1-7
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. Believing and hoping for the best for one another, honestly supporting,
    helping, protecting, caring for one another, even when the present does not
    look too rosy, as we see in the relationship between Ruth and Naomi – Ruth
    1:8-18
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c. Each family member playing his or her God-given role faithfully –
    Eph.5:22-33; 6:1-4
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d. Speaking the truth to one another always – Eph.4:15, 25
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    e. Submitting to one another particularly of the wife to the husband, the
    children to the parents and sometimes of the father/husband to the rest of
    the family – Eph.5:21
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    f. Speaking positive words about one another and covering one another’s
    weaknesses, particularly in their absence – Matt.1:18-19; I Pet.4:8
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    g. Praying and interceding for one another – Jas.5:16; Act 12:5
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    h. Counseling and correcting one another in love – Prov.27:5-6; 11:14;
    Eph.4:15
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. Forbearing with, and forgiving one another – Eph.4:31-32; Col.3:12-14
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    j. Bonding together to seek God, love God, serve God faithfully, and make
    it to heaven, regardless of whatever is happening in the external
    environment - Jos.24:15-18
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>How Are The Virtues Of Love And Loyalty Developed?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    While some measure of love and loyalty can sometimes be demonstrated by the
    people of the world, only the genuinely born again Christian who has fully
    submitted to the Lord and to the Holy Spirit can sincerely, consistently
    and increasingly demonstrate love and loyalty in family and friendship
    relationships. The Christian becomes strong in living a life of consistent
    love and loyalty in relationships in the following ways:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. Through genuine conversion – Jn.3:3-5; Rom.8:5-8
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. When the relationship is God-directed and has a good and Godly
    foundation – Ps.11:3; Prov.3:5-6
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c. Through maturity and spiritual growth, characterized by: being
    spirit-filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Word of God (including the
    study of other helpful materials), being reflective and learning from
    experience, having a teachable spirit, having the fear of God, having the
    consciousness of the law of sowing and reaping, and being driven by
    thoughts of heaven and of eternity – I Cor.3:1-4; Eph.4:11-15
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    There is no lesson or discussion that can be more practical than that of
    love and loyalty in relationships. We are all involved in relationships
    with family and friends. Such relationships play major role in enriching
    our lives, enhancing our ability to live in joy and happiness, helping us
    to achieve all-round success, and strengthening our walk with God and our
    preparedness to spend eternity with God. The Bible says that it is more
    blessed to give than to receive, and that when you give, more shall be
    given unto you, in good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running
    over. Our focus in life should be to have deeply loving heart, and to
    practically and constantly demonstrate the depth of our love through
    commitment, loyalty, caring and serving one another, in our relationships
    in the family, with friends, in the church, and even with neighbours. As we
    walk in love and loyalty, our lives will enrich other people’s lives,
    people will be drawn to the Lord through our lives, God will ensure that we
    reap the good seed we have sown in multiple-fold, we will live a life of
    all-round blessing, and we will reap our eternal rewards when we see our
    Lord face-to-face.

<p class="article"> 
    1. It is generally believed that the level of genuine love and loyalty in
    family and friendship relationship has drastically reduced in the last two
    to three decades. Do you agree with this position (if you have been long
    enough in the church to make a fair comparison)? If so, what reasons
    account for this decline, and what are the possible and effective
    solutions?

    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The subject of love and loyalty in relationships is very vital and central
    in the lives of our brethren. Let the teacher pray fervently ahead of this
    lesson, as with other lessons, and make the discussions as practical as
    possible. During the discussions, the teacher should be astute enough to
    know which of the points relate more to family relationship and which
    relate more to friendship relationship. The teacher should also do some
    research and studies on how best to handle the 2 pertinent questions in the
    Question and Discussion heading, in order to provide effective leadership
    and direction in the class discussions.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Message of the Holy Scriptures (Luke 23:25-27)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Scriptural message of salvation focuses on Jesus Christ: His suffering,
    trial/ judgment, crucifixion, burial and resurrection. He prepared His
    disciples for the coming events,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that
            He was Jesus the Christ. From that time Jesus began to show to His
            disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from
            the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be
            raised the third day” (Matt. 16:20-21).
        </em>
    </strong>
    In spite of the fact that Jesus had been proved by the Roman authorities to
    have done nothing deserving of death, the Jews cried out that a known
    insurrectionist, Barabbas, be released instead of Jesus. Pilate desired to
    release Jesus, affirming His innocence for a third time, “…but he finally
    gave in to their demand... and surrendered Jesus to their will” (Luke
    23:25).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When Jesus left Pilate's hall, He was compelled to carry His cross. It was
    a part of the prisoner's humiliation that he carries his own cross to the
    place of execution. Considering all that Jesus had endured since His arrest
    in the garden, it is not difficult to imagine Him falling under the load.
    But there is something more involved: carrying the cross was a sign of
    guilt, and our Lord was not guilty! The scripture says He bears our sin
    (Is. 53; 2 Cor. 5:21).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Ministry of the Holy Scriptures (Heb. 4:1-13)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God has promised us, as believers, spiritual inheritance in Christ.
    However, we must be careful lest we fail to believe God's Word, for it is
    only as the Word is "mixed with faith" that it can accomplish its purposes.
    “The argument in this section is given in several propositions: (1) God
    finished His work and rested, so that His rest has been available since
    creation. (2) The Jews failed to enter into their rest. (3) Many years
    later (Ps 95), God said that a rest was still available. That "today" is
    still here! This means that Joshua did not lead Israel into the true rest,
    because a rest still remains.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The children of Israel settling down in the “Promised Land”, Canaan, is a
    picture of the spiritual rest we find in Christ when we surrender to Him.
    When we come to Christ by faith, we find salvation rest (Matt. 11:28). When
    we yield and learn of Him and obey Him by faith, we enjoy submission rest
    (Matt. 11:29-30). The first is "peace with God" (Rom 5:1); the second is
    the "peace of God" (Phil. 4:6-8). It is by believing that we enter into
    rest (Heb. 4:3); it is by obeying God by faith and surrendering to His will
    that the rest enters into us.” We are therefore admonished to labour, "give
    diligence" in the opposite of "drifting" (Heb. 4:11). We can achieve this
    by paying close attention to the Word of God. The children of Israel did
    not believe God's Word, so the rebels fell in the wilderness. "So then
    faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God" (Rom. 10:17). The
    Word of God is compared to a sword, which cuts the heart of sinners with
    conviction (Acts 5:33; 7:54), and that the Word defeats Satan (Eph. 6:17).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Ministry of the Holy Scriptures (Psalm 119:105-120)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Scripture describes the word of God as living and powerful, and sharper
    than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit,
    and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
    the heart (Heb. 4:12). Psalms 119:105-112, 130 recognize God's Word as
    light to direct us. The psalmist vowed to follow it (Ps. 119:105-106). In
    his distress (Ps. 199:107-110) he called for help and affirmed that he
    would joyfully follow God's statutes and decrees (Ps. 119:111-112). The
    psalmist stated that he hated double-mindedness, and that he loved and
    hoped in God's Word because God was his Refuge (Ps. 119:113-120).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God's Word is the light that helps us follow the right path (Ps. 119:130;
    18:28; 19:8; 36:9; 43:3; Prov. 6:23; 2 Peter 1:19). The natural lamp/light
    illuminated the path only one step ahead. We do not see the whole route at
    one time, but we walk by faith when we follow the Word. We live in a dark
    world (John 1:5; 3:19; 8:12; 12:46; Col.1:13; 1 Peter 2:9) and only God's
    light can guide us aright. Obedience to the Word keeps us walking in the
    light (1 John 1:5-10). The Word of the God is a precious treasure. It is
    like a deep mine, filled with gold, silver, and precious gems, and we must
    take time to "dig" for these treasures (Prov. 2:1-9; 3:13-15; 8:10-11;
    1Cor. 3:9-23). A mere surface reading of Scripture will not put spiritual
    treasure into our hearts. Mining treasure is hard work, but it is joyful
    work when we "mine" the Bible, as the Spirit guides us into truth.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When Jesus left Pilate's hall, He was carrying His cross (John 19:17). It
    was a part of the prisoner's humiliation that he carries his own cross to
    the place of execution. Therefore, cross-bearing is a mark of Christianity
    (Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34, 15:21; Luke 9:23, 14:27; Col. 1:20, 2:14).
    But there is something more involved: carrying the cross was a sign of
    guilt, and our Lord was not guilty! We are admonished to endure hardness
    and persecution as good soldiers of Christ (2 Tim. 2:3, John 16:33).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Christ stands arraigned and condemned at Pilate's court. Then, the believer
    shall never be arraigned and condemned at God's bar. Christ stood at this
    time before a higher Judge than Pilate; He stood at God's bar as well as
    His. Pilate did but that which God's own hand and counsel had before
    determined to be done. Praise God! We have the judge of the universe as
    Father.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God upholds the obedient (Ps. 119:116-117). The word "sustain" pictures the
    believer leaning on the Lord for support and rest, while "uphold" means the
    same, plus the idea of giving aid and refreshment. When we feel like
    falling down and just giving up, the Lord comes to our aid in ways we could
    never fully understand. God rejects the wicked (Ps. 119: 118-119). God's
    people in the Old Testament fought their enemies with swords and slings,
    but God's people today use the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12).
    It is a conflict between truth and lies; and God's truth must prevail.

<p class="article"> 
    1. Pilate desired to release Jesus, affirming His innocence three times,
    but the Jews cried out that a known insurrectionist, Barabbas, be released
    instead of Jesus. What is the implication of this?

    Crucifixion was a common method of carrying out the death sentence in the
    Roman Empire. It was probably the most cruel and painful method of death
    the Romans knew. Crucifixion was reserved for the worst criminals; by law,
    a Roman citizen could not be crucified. Crucifixion was usually a long slow
    process, but Jesus died in a remarkably short period of time for He
    voluntarily "breathed His last" (Luke 23:46).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Jewish trial focused on the religious issue (blasphemy); but when the
    Jews sent Jesus to Pilate, it was the political issue they stressed ("He
    stirs up the people"). Pilate tried to send Jesus back to the Sanhedrin
    (John 18:31), but his ploy did not work. The chief priests and scribes
    insisted that the Roman governor ratify their decision. Pilate said he
    found no grounds for condemning Jesus, and this made the Jewish leaders
    even more vehement in their attempt to kill Jesus. They were contented in
    releasing a criminal, instead of Jesus Christ, the Righteous. The world
    loves darkness over the truth (John 3:18-21) and light.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Most times in our preaching and teaching, we so emphasize the physical
    aspects of our Lord's sufferings that we forget the spiritual agony that He
    endured on the cross in being separated from His Father. Jesus wants us to
    share "the fellowship of His sufferings" (Phil. 3:10) and not try to
    duplicate the feelings of His sufferings. This knowledge helps us to focus
    more on soul winning, because it is a terrible thing to be separated from
    God (spiritual separation/death). This is a dark world and the only
    dependable light is the Word of God (2 Peter 1:19-21). It leads us a step
    at a time, as we walk in obedience. 1 John 1:5-10 tells us we walk in the
    light as we obey His Word.<strong></strong>

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Existence of God (Isaiah 40:12-23)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The evidence and reality of the existence of God is manifested in creation.
    God is greater than anything on earth or anything in heaven. Creation shows
    His wisdom, power, and immensity. He is greater than the nations and their
    gods. He founded the earth and sits on the throne of heaven. In Isaiah
    40:12-23, the Jews were facing a long and difficult journey. The victories
    of Assyria, Babylon, and Persia made it look as though the false gods of
    the Gentiles were stronger than the God of Israel, but Isaiah reminded the
    people of the greatness of Jehovah.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Someone has defined "circumstances" as "those nasty things you see when you
    get your eyes off of God." If you look at God through your circumstances,
    He will seem small and very far away, but if by faith you look at your
    circumstances through God. He will draw very near and reveal His greatness
    to you.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Nature of God (Acts 17:22-31)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the Creator, although there are many theories and myth concerning
    creation. The Greeks believed different theories about creation, and even
    held to a form of evolution. However Apostle Paul clearly stated that God
    created everything and did not live in temples made by men. God gives life
    to all; man can really give nothing to Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the Governor and Ruler of the universe. He appoints the boundaries
    of the nations. Through His government of the nations, He seeks to make men
    seek Him and find Him. Paul quoted a Greek writer to show that God is the
    sustainer of life. He technically pointed out that their temples and images
    were foolish and ignorant.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the Mighty Saviour. With all the professed wisdom of the Greek, they
    could not find God (1 Cor. 1:18). Apostle Paul wipes away the great Greek
    culture by calling it "times of ignorance"! He declared that God has
    commanded men everywhere to repent; and if they repent and believe, He will
    forgive.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is the Judge. God has appointed a day of judgment, and the Judge will
    be His Son, Jesus Christ. God proved this by raising Him from the dead. If
    we trust Christ today, He will save us; if we reject Him, tomorrow, He will
    judge us.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Attributes of God (Isaiah 44:1-10; I John 3:1-12)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God is faithful, gracious, merciful, loving, longsuffering etc. When God
    forgives, He restores. God chose Israel and redeemed them, but He also
    formed them for Himself (Is. 44:1-20). Because God formed them, chose them,
    and redeemed them, they had nothing to fear. He will pour water on the land
    and His Spirit on the people (Is. 59:21; Ezek 34:26; Joel 2:28-29; John
    7:37-39), and both will prosper to the glory of the Lord.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Isaiah declared the uniqueness of God (Isaiah 44:6-8). The Lord is the only
    God; therefore idol-worship is illogical and absurd. His uniqueness and
    sovereignty shows His contrast with the idols. Several titles stress God's
    sovereignty: “Israel's King” (Is. 43:15), Redeemer (Is. 43:14), the LORD
    Almighty God, and the First and the Last i.e. the eternal One (Is. 48:12;
    Rev 1:17; 2:8; 22:13). The Lord argued for His uniqueness -apart from Me
    there is no God- (Isa 43:11; 44:6; 46:9) by challenging anyone to tell of
    the past and the future (Is. 44:7, 41:22-23). Since His knowledge of the
    future proves His uniqueness, His people should not be afraid (Is.
    41:10,14; 43:5; 44:2; 54:4). They themselves are witnesses (Is. 43:10,12)
    to His uniqueness, strength, and stability (Is. 17:10; 26:4; 30:29).

    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The existence of God is not questionable. Only a fool can deny God. “For
    the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
    seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power
    and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew
    God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain
    in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
    themselves to be wise, they became fools” (Rom. 1:20-22).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Acts chapter 17 presents three different attitudes toward the Gospel, and
    we find these same attitudes in the world today. Some people openly oppose
    the Word; some mock it or postpone making a decision; and some receive the
    Word and believe. Paul kept right on going as a faithful servant, and so
    must we, "for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not" (Gal 6:9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Apostle Paul politely, logically and technically addressed the Greek. He
    called their attention to an altar dedicated "TO THE UNKNOWN GOD," and he
    used this object to preach to them the True God about whom they were
    ignorant. It would be wise for us to follow his pattern.

    There are many concepts and beliefs about God and creation story. But
    Jehovah is the Supreme God over gods and deities. The concept of Trinity is
    unique to Christianity and must be sustained, explained and made plain to
    students. Let the students express their views about the nature and
    attributes of God from personal experiences. Next week’s lesson will deal
    more on this subject.

<p class="article"> 
    When Apostle Paul came to Athens, he discovered that the famous city was a
    center of religion and culture. All he could see was sin and superstition.
    One ancient writer said it was easier to find a god than a man in Athens.
    Paul disputed with the Jews in the synagogue, but had little or no success.
    He then followed the pattern of the Greek teachers and took his message to
    the market (agora) where the men assembled to discuss philosophy or to
    transact business. This is a great lesson for us today to take advantage of
    marketplace ministry.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Two main philosophies controlled Athens at that time: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. The Stoics were materialistic and almost fatalistic in their thinking.
    Their system was built on pride and personal independence. Nature was their
    god, and they believed that all nature was gradually moving toward a great
    climax. We might say that they were pantheistic.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. The Epicureans desired pleasure, and their philosophy was grounded in
    experience, not reason. They were almost atheistic.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Here we have two extremes in philosophy, and Paul confronted them both with
    the Gospel of Christ. We should maintain our stand knowing that God is
    supreme and sovereign over all.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Trinity of the Godhead </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The doctrine of Trinity can easily be understood from Romans 1:20,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are
            clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even
            his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.”
        </em>
    </strong>
    Divine Trinity means that there are three separate and distinct persons in
    the Godhead (the Father, Son and Holy Spirit). It expresses one in unity as
    well as one in number (1 John 5:7; John 17:11, 21-23). There are three
    separate persons in divine individuality and divine plurality. As
    individual person, each can be called God and collectively they can be
    spoken of as one God because of their perfect unity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - The Father is called God (1 Cor. 8:6).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - The Son (Jesus Christ) is called God (Isaiah 9:6-7; Heb. 1:8; John 1:1-2,
    20:28).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - The Holy Spirit is called God (Acts 5:3-4).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the scripture, Trinity describes the three-in-one nature of the Father,
    Son, and Holy Spirit, we also see all the three members of the Trinity
    together:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - In Mark 1:10-11, the Holy Spirit descended like a dove on Jesus, and the
    voice proclaimed the Father’s approval of Jesus as His divine Son.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - In Acts 1:4-5, it describes the unique relationship of the Trinity - God
    the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    - In Matthew 28:19, Jesus’ word affirms the reality of the Trinity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>God the Father (John 3:14-36)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the Christendom, God is conceived of as "Father". The scripture
    declares, "Our Father ... in heaven" (Matt 6:9,14,26), "the God and Father
    of the Lord Jesus" (2Cor. 11:31). It expresses the tenderness of relation
    and wealth of love and grace embraced in God. Pagan religions also could
    speak of God as "Father", and in the general sense of being the Creator,
    God has a universal fatherly relation to the world (Acts 17:24-28). In the
    Old Testament, God was revealed as Father to the chosen nation (Ex. 4:22).
    God’s fatherly love is declared to be the image of His pity for those who
    fear Him (Ps. 103:13). The meaning of Fatherhood in God is made clear in
    John 1:18.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The concept of Father as applied to God can be seen in these passages (Ex.
    4:22; Deut. 32:6; 2 Sam. 7:14; Ps. 89:27,28, etc.). It also denotes His
    covenant relation to the Jews (Jer. 31:9; Isa. 63:16; 64:8; John 8:41,
    etc.). Believers are called God's "sons" (John 1:12; Rom 8:16; Matt
    6:4,8,15,18; 10:20,29). They also call him "Father" (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3;
    2 Cor. 1:2; Gal 1:4). In John 3:16 the eternal love of the Father was
    expressed in sending His begotten Son to pay the wages of man’s sin and
    purchase eternal redemption for humanity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Nature of Jesus Christ (Matt.16:1-20)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The name Jesus signifies saviour. It is the Greek form of JEHOSHUA
    (Joshua). The name Christ signifies anointed (John 1:41), the name given to
    the long-promised Prophet and King whom the Jews had been taught by their
    prophets to expect (Matt 11:3; Acts 19:4). Other names are sometimes added
    to the names Jesus Christ: "Lord," "a King," "King of Israel," "Emmanuel,"
    "Son of David," "chosen of God." Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary,
    God being his father, at Bethlehem of Judea. The twofold designation “Jesus
    Christ” combines the personal name ‘Jesus’ and the title ‘Christ’, meaning
    "anointed" or "Messiah." The significance of this title became clear during
    the scope of His life and ministry.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Matthew chapter 16 portrays Jesus as offering Himself as the Lamb of God.
    He healed the sick, He fed the crowds, He continued to warn against the
    Pharisees who had been unable to interpret the many signs of the King's
    presence. And then, Jesus asked the fateful question: "Who do men say that
    the Son of man is?" And the disciples report confirmed what had already
    been made clear. The nation had rejected Jesus. Peter's confession of
    faith, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (Matt. 16:16), was a
    confession which Israel could not and would not make. After Peter's
    affirmation, Jesus called Peter blessed. God had revealed Christ's identity
    to him. And Jesus went on to say, "On this rock I will build My church." We
    need personal revelation of Jesus Christ to excel in our Christian race.

    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The co-existence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in the unity
    of the Godhead (divine nature or essence) is termed as Trinity. The
    doctrine of the Trinity means that within the being and activity of the one
    God, there are three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This
    explained why God demands brotherly love from us which promotes unity,
    oneness and understanding of one another with a view to gender peaceful
    co-existence. The early church manifested the power of God in such great
    dimension because they were in one accord. In unity lies the power.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Father gives all authority to the Son and bears witness to Him, as does
    Jesus to Himself (John 8:18). Yet, the Son claims nothing for Himself; He
    gives all glory to the Father who has sent Him (John 12:49-50). The key to
    unlocking the mystery of the Trinity is to observe how the persons of the
    triune family give themselves to one another in selfless love. They are
    always at one another's disposal. We must be our brother’s keeper.

    The word ‘Trinity’ cannot be found in Scripture, but used to express the
    doctrine of the unity of God as subsisting in three distinct Persons. This
    word is derived from the Greek ‘trias’, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168
    A.D. - 183 A.D.), or from the Latin ‘trinitas’, first used by Tertullian
    (A.D. 220 A.D.), to express this doctrine.

<p class="article"> 
    We believe that people who have been born again should be baptized in the
    name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus Himself was baptized and
    instructed His followers to be baptized. Baptism also confirms that Christ
    is the Lord and King in each believer’s life (Romans 6:4). We believe in
    observing the Lord’s Supper or communion, just as Jesus instructed. This
    means that born again believers take the broken bread and the fruit of the
    vine as a remembrance and celebration of the new life that is theirs
    because of Jesus’ death on the cross and His resurrection. It is also
    looking forward to His return as triumphant King (I Corinthians 11:24-26).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Baptism is by Immersion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    There are some types of baptism apart from that of immersion. They emerge
    from ecclesiastical tradition. A notable one is effusion or sprinkling.
    This could be done on anyone wanting to be baptized. It is often done in
    infant baptism which has become controversial. Baptism by immersion has
    very strong scriptural basis hence it is the one accepted by Evangelicals
    and Pentecostals. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the model for the baptism by
    immersion done at the age of accountability. The weakness in doing infant
    baptism is in the fact that the child being baptized does not know what is
    happening to him or her, whereas baptism is to be on the basis of the
    testimony of the person to be baptized, having received the Lord Jesus
    Christ as his or her Saviour, which is the sure salvation experience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our Lord Jesus Christ humbled Himself to be baptized as an adult by
    immersion by John the Baptist in River Jordan (Matt. 3:13-15). That was the
    river that Naaman the Syrian Army General hesitated to patronize, though
    eventually through the counsel of his servants went and got perfectly
    healed of his leprosy (II Kings 5:13-14).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Baptism is NOT Salvation.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As against the wrong doctrine held to by some individuals baptism is not
    salvation. Baptism is an outward manifestation of an inward work of grace
    that had been done. It is easy to uphold the belief that baptism should be
    a means of salvation going by the ceremony and the psychological feeling.
    Many religions had capitalized on outward ceremonies to result in true
    spiritual experience like in the days of prophet Amos. This is not true.
    Ceremonies not backed with true basics do not guarantee divine encounter.
    Simon the sorcerer thought that there is a short cut to experiencing the
    power of the Holy Spirit, hence his offering of money to Peter to sell the
    power to him. He was cursed for it. (Acts 8:18-24). Baptism does not lead
    to salvation. It should be the sequel to having had the inward work of
    grace done.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Importance of Water Baptism.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This lies chiefly in its being a command from our Lord and Saviour Jesus
    Christ (Matt 28:16-20). It is part of the Great Commission. Another reason
    for its importance is that it registers the humility and the spirit of
    obedience of everyone who subjects himself or herself to the exercise.
    Another importance is the fact that as human beings who tend to get assured
    more of spiritual experiences, it is a concrete encounter that could be
    easily referred to, despite the fact that baptism is not salvation.
    Finally, it makes the word of God seen and obeyed.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>Water Baptism taught through the Bible</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Bible is the first point of reference on all the issues of Christian
    living. Baptism among other issues is best taught through the Bible. There
    the commanded phenomenon of water baptism is made clear. Water baptism is
    not pronounced in the Old Testament. The intertestamental period must have
    produced the ritual cleansings in Hebrew history prior to the advent of
    Jesus Christ. The stage in the New Testament opened with John the Baptist
    as a fore runner and herald of Jesus Christ calling the populace of his
    time to the baptism unto repentance (Matt 3:1-10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As already indicated, Jesus established water baptism as an ordinance in
    the Great Commission. This is reported by both Matthew and Mark (Matt.
    28:19; Mark 16:16). Peter re-echoed the command to be baptized in his
    sermon on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:38, 41). Throughout the book of
    Acts, the Apostles observed the ordinance, baptizing their converts: Acts
    8:12; 8:36-38; 9:18; 10:47,48; 16:15; 16:33; 18:8; 19:5,6; 22:16). The
    spiritual significance of water baptism is taught in the Epistles (Rom.
    6:3; I Cor. 10:2; Gal. 3:27).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>V. </strong>
    <strong>The Record of the Early Church.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The early church continued obeying the command of getting those who believe
    in the Lord Jesus baptized. The church faithfully observed water baptism as
    a sacrament. There is not much in the New Testament to substantiate this.
    Thanks however to church history which furnished us with the knowledge of
    the practice of water baptism at least in the first century A. D. The book
    of Acts and Paul’s epistles gave us much insight to the early church
    observance of that sacrament.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <a href="https://www.ministrymagazine.org/authors/rice-george-e.html">
        George E. Rice
    </a>
    informed us about baptism in the early church that “the evolution of
    Christian baptism through the centuries has been recorded in mortar and
    bricks, paint and mosaics. Among the ruins of early Christian structures,
    and also in ancient churches still in use, the history of Christian baptism
    can be traced. Paintings in catacombs and churches, mosaics on floors,
    walls, and ceilings, sculptured reliefs, and drawings in ancient New
    Testament manuscripts add details to this history, as well as raising
    interesting questions that need further investigation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The record left by these various witnesses overwhelmingly testifies to
    immersion as the normal mode of baptism in the Christian church during the
    first ten to fourteen centuries.<sup> </sup>This is in addition to the
    evidence found throughout the writings of the church fathers that immersion
    was the early church's common mode of baptism. Most students of church
    history are acquainted with the early written record about baptism, but
    what do the mosaics, the mortar, the brick, and the paint say?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    For some time scholarly circles have been discussing the origin of
    Christian baptism. Some see its origin in the mystery cults that flourished
    during the first century A.D. Actually, it is not necessary to go beyond
    the religious heritage in which Christianity has its roots—the religion of
    Israel.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It could be safely concluded that water baptism by immersion has a very
    strong biblical and church historical basis to make it the most acceptable
    practice. Submitting to water baptism particularly by immersion is a proof
    of humility which should always manifest in our Christian journey. It makes
    us to put our pride aside when we are ready to enter into the same water
    that others to be baptized will also enter. Naaman rated River Jordan as
    having not a great status as the rivers of his nation. His healing however
    came to be as a result of eventually humbling himself. May we pursue
    humility and always aim to be like Jesus our Lord. He subjected Himself to
    be baptized by John the Baptist in River Jordan a less esteemed river.
    Jesus submitted to immersion to fulfil all righteousness. May we pursue
    righteousness.

    The passage used at times to argue for effusion as against immersion is
    Acts 16:31-34. The argument is that the jailer’s household baptism was in
    the night, so where would Paul and Silas have got running water to baptize
    them by immersion? Another argument in favour of infant baptism is the
    entire jailer’s household was baptized and this must have included children
    and probably some infants.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The manner of water baptism is by immersion. This is seen in the meaning of
    the Greek word <em>baptizo</em> which clearly means to immerse, even by the
    admission of scholars whose churches sprinkle and by the biblical
    description of the manner of Jesus’ baptism in the River Jordan.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The formula for water baptism as taught in the Bible is clearly stated in
    the Great Commission as “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
    the Holy Spirit.” Statements about being baptized “in the name of Jesus”
    omit the longer formula and emphasize the Christian baptism as distinct
    from John’s baptism.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Origin of the Lord’s Supper (Gen. 3:21;</strong>
    <strong>Exod. 12:11-13; Luke 22:15-16; John 1:36)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The origin of the Lord’s Supper dates back to the Old Testament. The
    foundation was the Passover instituted by God to dramatically bring into
    reality the deliverance of the Israelites from their 430 year bondage in
    Egypt. The Lord Jesus Christ referred to Exod. 12:11-13 as the basis for
    him to observe it along with His disciples.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus in Luke 22:15-16 said, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover
    with you before I suffer. For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it
    finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God." The Passover was copiously
    observed in the Old Testament at different periods, particularly during the
    reign of Josiah who used it to usher in national revival and reform. It
    however ceased to be observed at the close of the Old Testament. Not until
    after some 400 years known as the ‘intertestamental period’ was it
    resuscitated in the New Testament during the life of our Lord Jesus Christ,
    who observed it legally. The Passover event is the bedrock of Jesus’
    sacrificial offering of Himself. The very remote origin was in the Garden
    of Eden when God killed an animal whose skin was used to cover the
    nakedness of Adam and Eve after their expulsion from the garden.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    “The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them”
    (Gen 3:21).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus paschal offering had another very remote origin as the lamb that was
    slain for our redemption at the foundation of the creation of the world,
    “When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes
    away the sin of the world! (John 1:29).

    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        The Pattern of the Lord’s Supper. (Exod. 12:24-28, 1-4; I Cor.
        11:23ff.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The pattern of the Lord’s Supper is the Old Testament event as seen in
    Exod. 12:24-28. After the preliminary instructions in 12:1-4, the pattern
    was established from vv. 24-28. The Israelites did just what the Lord
    commanded Moses and Aaron. The pattern was followed throughout the Old
    Testament and into the New during Jesus’ time. Jesus held to the ceremony
    as the basis for His own death at Calvary. In fact He was the Passover
    Lamb. The church however later deviated from the Old Testament tradition
    and imbibed the Christ pattern in as much as He has fulfilled the Old
    Testament Passover pattern to the letter.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Paul in I Cor. 11:23-26 wrote and documented the Christ pattern as
    performed by Christ Himself. The New Testament pattern as documented by
    Paul is from verses 23-33. This is the pattern that the Church had been
    operating on. There had been over the centuries aberrations of this pattern
    within various church denominations. There may be noted two main divergent
    Eucharistic approaches, namely, the Roman Catholic and the Protestant.

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Purpose of the Lord’s Supper. </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This is as stated in I Cor. 11:26ff. "This is my body, which is for you; do
    this in remembrance of me." In verses 25-26: “In the same way, after supper
    he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do
    this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me. For whenever you eat
    this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he
    comes.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>IV. </strong>
    <strong>The Perils of the Lord’s Supper. </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The peril is implied in 1 Cor. 11:27-34. Despite its being a holy and sober
    exercise there is the peril of human depravity making the ceremony to be
    disrespected, mishandled and abused, hence Paul’s injunction. It seems Paul
    still had more instructions to give out hence his saying, “And when I come
    I will give further directions” (I Cor. 11:34). Paul would want the dire
    consequences of the abuse of the Eucharist to be avoided.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>V. </strong>
    <strong>A Covenant and Communion (I Cor. 11:23-26)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When meals are shared together by a group of people, sharing is both
    covenant and communion because they have affinity towards themselves. Love
    is expressed in the sharing. After the communion such love and faithfulness
    is expected to continue. None of the members of the group is expected to
    harm the others. Laban and his nephew Jacob with his household ate together
    as they were parting ways and promised not to do any harm to themselves
    (Gen. 31:54). The scenario for the Holy Communion observance documented by
    Paul in I Cor. 11:23ff. should be observed as covenant and communion and
    with the mind-set of living for the Lord Jesus Christ, and doing His will.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Lord’s Supper has been given other expressions such as Eucharist and
    Holy Communion. Some aged Christians through many years of observance see
    it as “receiving the body of Christ”, while some others esteem it as eating
    “sacrament”. The observance of the Lord’s Supper is heavily revered by long
    standing Christians. They do not take it lightly. The younger generation of
    Christians should be mentored towards approaching the Lord’s Supper with
    sanctity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Are the bread and the wine being used as the elements of the Holy
    Communion the very body of our Lord Jesus Christ as believed in some
    quarters as trans-substantiation?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Do they serve as medication to our body when taken?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. How readily are we to accept the Lord’s Supper as a reminder of covenant
    relationship?

    God instituted the Feast of Passover when the Children of Israel were to be
    delivered from slavery in the land Egypt. This feast was to mark a new age
    in the history of Israel (the first month, the first month of the year).
    Though the events occurred in the seventh" month according to the civil
    year (which began in September-October) this is the first month in Israel's
    religious calendar. This month is called Abib (lit., "fresh young ears" of,
    e.g., barley). This was when barley was to be harvested (March-April). With
    a new calendar the Israelites were to receive a new identity as the
    favoured people of the true God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our Lord Jesus recognized this ordinance by observing it with His
    disciples. The disciples who were sent to make preparations for the
    Passover meal were Peter and John (Luke 22:8). The two disciples...
    prepared the Passover, that is, they purchased and prepared the food, which
    probably took them the greater part of the day. When evening came, Jesus
    entered the prepared room, an "upper" (upstairs) room (Luke 22:12), and
    partook of the Passover supper with the Twelve.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The early church also observed the ordinance. Apostle Paul reminded the
    Corinthians of the significance of the Lord’s Supper that it came with the
    Lord's authority (1 Cor. 11:23-26). The bread represented the incarnate
    body of Christ unselfishly assumed (Phil 2:6-7) and unselfishly given on
    the cross for the benefit of others (2Cor 8:9; Phil 2:8), that kept needing
    to be remembered (1Cor 4:8-13, 11:25). The wine was a poignant reminder of
    Christ's blood, without the shedding of which there could be no forgiveness
    from sin (Heb. 9:22) and through which cleansing and a new relationship
    (covenant) with God was made (Heb. 9:14-15).

    <em>
        We believe that the baptism with the Holy Spirit is an experience that
        follows salvation. All believers have God`s Spirit within them. Holy
        Spirit baptism empowers believers to exalt JESUS, to live a life of
        holiness and to be a witness of God`s saving grace. We believe that
        those who experience the Holy Spirit baptism today will experience it
        in the same manner that believers experienced it in the early Church.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The God head is triune in existence and we sometimes describe Him as
    Trinity. This means that the Creator, God, is made up of three
    personalities who we know to be God the Father, God the Son and God the
    Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>What is the Baptism with the Holy Spirit?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Baptism with the Holy Spirit or in the Holy Spirit in Christian theology is
    a term describing baptism (washing or immersion) in or with the Spirit of
    God and is frequently associated with incorporation into the Christian
    Church, the bestowal of SPIRITUAL GIFTS, and empowerment for Christian
    ministry.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The term “Baptism with the Holy Spirit “originates in the New Testament and
    all Christian traditions accept it as a theological concept. Nevertheless,
    different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its
    meaning in a variety of ways due to differences in the doctrines of
    salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, spirit baptism has been variously
    defined as part of the sacraments of invitation into the Church, as being
    synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection
    or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian
    life and service.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Before the emergence of the holiness movement in the mid – 19<sup>th</sup>
    century and Pentecostalism in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, most
    denominations believed that Christians received the baptism with the Holy
    Spirit either upon conversion and regeneration or through rites of
    Christian initiation, such as water baptism and confirmation. Since the
    growth and spread of Pentecostal and Charismatic Churches, however, the
    belief that baptism with the Holy Spirit is an EXPERIENCE distinct from
    Christian initiation has come into increasing prominence.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        The Purpose and Necessity of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The purpose of the baptism with the Holy Spirit is for great spiritual
    transformation, upliftments and cleansing, for the promise is “He shall
    baptize you with the Holy Spirit and Fire” Luke 3:16b ( and the thought of
    fire as used in this connection is the thought of searching, refining,
    cleansing, consuming)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A wonderful transformation took place in the lives of the Apostles at
    Pentecost and a wonderful transformation has taken place in thousands who
    have been baptized with the Holy Spirit since Pentecost, but the primary
purpose of the baptism with the Holy Spirit is efficiency in    <strong>TESTIMONY</strong> and<strong> SERVICE. </strong>It has to do with
    gifts for service than with graces of character. It is the impartation of
    spiritual power or gifts in service and sometimes one may have rare gifts
    by the Spirit`s power and yet manifest few of the graces of the Spirit (1
    Corinthians 13:1-3, Mathew 7:22,23). In every passage in the Bible in which
    the baptism with the Holy Spirit is mentioned, it is connected with
    testimony or service. However, the New Testament has much to say about the
    necessity for the baptism with the Holy Spirit. When our Lord was about to
    leave His disciples to be with the Father, He said,
    <strong>
        “And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in
        the City of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on High” (Luke
        24:49)
    </strong>
    . He had just commissioned them to be His witnesses to all nations
    beginning at Jerusalem (verses 47, 48) but here He tells them that before
    they undertake this witnessing they must <strong><u>WAIT </u></strong>until
    they receive the promise of the Father and were thus endued with the power
    from on high for the work of the witnessing which they were to undertake.
    <strong>
        Those That Wait For The Baptism Of The Holy Ghost Cannot Waste In Life
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion<u></u></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Gospel of John 20:22 shows that the disciples of Jesus were already
    born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. The Book of Acts
    chapter 2:8,10 and 19 shows that it was common in the New Testament for
    Spirit baptism to occur after <strong><u>conversion.</u></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In following the Biblical pattern, Christians today should also ask Jesus
    for this Baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witnessing
    – Acts 1:8
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In classical Pentecostalism, the Baptism with the Holy Spirit is understood
    to be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometimes after
    regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping spirit filled
    believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this is the belief that
    all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and
    exercised to build up the Church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism
    will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues- Acts
    2:1-4.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The diverse views on Spirit baptism held among Christian traditions could
    be categorized into three main groups.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    These are baptism with Spirit as:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Sacramental Initiation (Orthodox and Catholic Churches)

    <strong>We receive by asking- </strong>
    <strong>1 John 5:14-15, Luke 11:19</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        “And this is the confidence that we have in Him , that if we <u>ask</u>
        anything according to His will, He heareth us”
    </em>

    <strong>We receive through the prayer of faith – for example:</strong>
    Dear Lord, I thank you that you shed your blood on Calvary`s cross for my
    sins, I ask for forgiveness for my sins and I do acknowledge you as my Lord
    and Saviour. I ask you to baptize me in the Holy Spirit. I claim by faith
    the baptism in the Holy Spirit right now. Thank you Jesus. Amen
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion<u></u></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the rest and refreshing promised in Old
Testament prophecy promised by Isaiah hundreds of years before Pentecost,    <strong>Isaiah 32:15,</strong> your prayer language is a permanent gift,
    but the gifts of the Holy Spirit are supernaturally given to individuals as
    the Spirit wills; so we cannot claim any permanent gift of the Holy Spirit.

        earnestly desire the best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent
