    <em>
        Should a Christian be patriotic? The answer to this question depends on
        the meaning of the word “patriotic.” As with many words, there are
        different nuances of meaning, and different people use the word in
        different ways. For example, at its simplest meaning being patriotic
        simply means “loving one’s country.” As long as that love for country
        does not supersede one’s love for God, and if it is kept in proper
        perspective, there is nothing wrong with a Christian being patriotic.
    </em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    However, another definition of “patriotic” implies that the individual
    should place the interests of the nation above his or her personal and
    group interests. Carried to this extreme, patriotism can become a form of
    idolatry, particularly if one’s love for his country is greater than his
    love for God and God’s plan of redeeming people from “every tribe, tongue
    and nation.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1<sup>st</sup> October every year, we celebrate the founding of our nation,
    which we can trace to the amalgamation of 1914. We have evolved through
    many historical phases before we got to this present democratic
    dispensation of 2016.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    My prayer is that our leaders will use this teaching to remind the
    congregations, as well as friends and families, as to the Christian
    standard expected of us to stand up for the good of the country which we
    proudly call our own.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Being Patriotic! How Far?</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As far as a Christian’s responsibility towards government, we know from
    Romans 13:1-7 that we are to be subject to the governing authorities and to
    honor them, even when they are not honorable, because it is ultimately God
    who has placed them in authority over us. So, as Christians, we are under
    obligation to God to be model citizens, subject to the governing
    authorities over us by obeying laws, paying taxes, etc. However, our
    responsibilities are first and foremost to be obedient to God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In a democratic republic where individual citizens have the ability to
    change and influence government by voting or by being politically involved
    when appropriate and inappropriate ways, part of being a good citizen is
    voting and having whatever positive influence we can on government.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All individuals and families naturally and inevitably belong to larger
    communities: a local community (the town, city, or the country), perhaps
    some intermediate community such as a local government areas or state, and
    a country or nation. Patriotism is love for one’s country or nation and
    loyalty to it.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Patriotism itself must be distinguished from immoderate nationalism,
    because there are some specific responsibilities flowing from patriotism.
    But since love for and loyalty toward the smaller, local community is
    analogous to patriotism, it can be applied with appropriate qualifications
    to one’s attitude and duties toward both the local government and any
    intermediate community, such as the state or the whole country.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Patriotism! The Christ Followers!</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Patriotism has significant emotional components, but centrally it should be
    a volitional love: the steady willing of the true good of one’s nation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Patriotic feelings must be shaped by sound judgment and good will. Provided
    it is integrated with the steady willing of the true good of the community,
    emotional attachment to one’s nation is a powerful motive for fulfilling
    the responsibilities of authentic patriotism. Unless patriotic feelings are
    shaped by sound judgment and integrated with an upright will, however, they
    easily lead to moral failings of various kinds.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The followers of Christ should be seen as a people who are sojourners,
    strangers, exiles, and refugees in this world - Hebrews 11:13; 1 Peter
    2:11; Philippians 3:20. A happy, peaceful, loving people who swear
    allegiance to a foreign king, Jesus Christ, and to no other.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our patriotism as Christians must be seen as a people who reside in every
    nation but whose all-determining citizenship is in heaven, from which we
    await our King and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. We must live, believe in
    Christ for the world to see us as the freest of all peoples in the world.
    Free from fear and greed because the kingdom to which we belong cannot be
    shaken - Hebrews 12:28, and because our true fatherland is heaven - Hebrews
    11:16), and the city of our destiny has God as its builder and maker -
    Hebrews 11:10.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We are a free people, we have our liberty in Christ and because our minds
    are not conformed to this age but are transformed by the mercies of God, so
    that we are not enslaved by fashion or fad or any other form of
    covetousness, our strong desires are not shaped by the persuaders of this
    world but shaped by the messages coming from the Holy Spirit. O for a
    church with a single and radical allegiance to the King of kings who said,
    "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Patriotism! Celebrating Our Nationhood!</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As Christians we are expected to lead and live by example, unfortunately
    many end-time manifestations have confirmed that not everyone who says
    ‘Lord’ are truly and genuinely born again Christians.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    However, for us as members of The Foursquare Family, we should celebrate
    our nationhood, we must appreciate where God has put us, we must appreciate
    that every nation has their peculiarities, nations evolve in stages, our
    national symbols and ceremonies that reflect significant events of our life
    must be honored, we must imbibe attitudes that tend to bind us into unity
    than those that divide us. Our patriotism towards our country must
    therefore be respected alongside the complex process of adopting, altering,
    abolishing, re-establishing and inventing our national values.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our national flags, our national anthem, the national pledge of allegiance
    to our country under God are central to our nationhood and are used to
    represent, justify and glorify our pride for our nation. The use of our
    national flags and participation in our nation’s ceremonies help symbolize
    commonality and the oneness of our nation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We must endorse every engagement, every activity, every ceremony that will
    bring about the unity of the country without compromising our faith, we
    must avoid such ceremonies that have no relationship with the Bible, we
    must avoid their unholy sacrifice and still yet demonstrate our love to
    every one especially those that are in need.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Perhaps the most important distinction to be made by Christians is that our
    first love must be the kingdom of God, over and above any love of country,
    no matter how pure and honorable that love might be.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It's easy for Christians to begin to worship their country as an idol. In
    The Four Loves, C. S. Lewis puts the matter quite succinctly. He notes that
    love of country "becomes a demon when it becomes a god." In short, we can
    too easily allow our celebration of nation to intertwine with and pervert
    our love of God, and in many cases, usurp our love for God. We see how
    humanity has twisted almost every gift of God into an idol that can
    sinfully replace him. Money, sex, work, food, drink—each of these (among
    others) have become damaging idols for too many Christians. It wouldn't
    take long for any of us to think of examples of when Christians have placed
    love of country above love of God—the end result is disastrous.

<p class="article"> 
    1. Should a Christian be patriotic to one’s country?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. What biblical example can we lay claim to of patriotism to encourage our

    <strong>Teaching Overview/ Insight</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In countries where Christians have no say in the decisions of their
    leaders, it is more difficult to be patriotic. It is very hard to love
    oppressive governments. However, as Christians we are still obligated to
    obey and pray for our leaders - 1Timothy 2:1-4. God will honor our
    obedience to this command, and in His perfect timing, He will judge leaders
    who turn away from Him.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Should a Christian be patriotic? Within reason, yes. At the same time, a
    Christian’s ultimate faith, love, and obedience are to be reserved for God
    alone. How, then, should Christians distinguish between patriotism and
    nationalism? Well, as in most things, it's best to know what Jesus did.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Luke 19, there's a peculiar story about Jesus. In the midst of the pomp
    and glory of the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Jesus begins to weep. He
    weeps because the city-and, by extension, all Israel—failed to recognize
    his lordship, and because he knew the impending destruction of Jerusalem.
    The scene echoed a previous lament over Jerusalem -Luke 13:31-35. Jesus, it
    seems, loved his people, his city, his nation—so much so that he cried over
    it.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus' example of patriotism perfected can provide a guidepost to
    Christians. It's an example that's shot through with justice, truth, and
    love. It's not a nationalistic patriotism—it's a love for nation that
    doesn't pit it against other nations. Instead, it’s recognition of love
    followed by a mournful recognition of shortcomings.

        We believe that Jesus Christ heals people who are sick. God does not
        change; He is still willing and able to heal the body, as well as the
        soul and spirit, in response to faith (Matt.16:17-18; James 5:14-16).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The ministry of healing is a key part of the gospel of the Kingdom. The
    great truth that God heals runs all through the Bible. God is a healing God
    (Ex.15:26). Christ is a healing Christ (1Peter 2:24). The Word is a healing
    Word (Psalm 107:20). The Believers Church, New Testament Church was a
    healing community (Acts 15:12). God wants His Church to be an instrument of
    healing to the people in this generation. Both Old and New Testaments give
    witness to God’s provision for the healing of our sicknesses and diseases.
    A considerable portion of Christ’s earthly ministry was concerned directly
    with ministering physical healing to the sick and afflicted. The history of
    the Church is full of account of great healings and miracles done in the
    name of Jesus.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Divine healing is the natural and supernatural processes by which the
    Almighty God repairs the body, soul and spirit. A single act of
    disobedience plugged the human race into a dark fall from the presence of
    God: Eating the fruit of the tree which God had said;
    <strong>
        <em>
            “but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat
            of it”
        </em>
    </strong>
    . Gen. 2:16-17 brought not only spiritual death to the human race, but also
    ultimately physical death. Sickness entered into the world when Adam fell.
    Today, sin still causes sickness. Apart from sickness and diseases caused
    by sin, demonic powers and neglect of health can also cause sickness. But
    through God’s redemptive provision, healing for the body, soul and spirit
became accessible to all who call upon the name of Jesus for salvation    <strong>.</strong>

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Redemptive Name of God</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The redemptive name of God is a name used in conjunction with the name of
    Jehovah, which expresses the particular aspect of redemption He has
    provided.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>Jehovah Jireh</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Meaning ‘the Lord will provide’ (Gen. 22:14). How wonderful to know that
    God has committed Himself to provide for us a Redeemer, one who dies in our
    place.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>Jehovah Rapha</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Meaning ‘I Am the Lord that healeth thee’ (Ex.15:26). Not only that God
    revealed Himself as Saviour and Deliverer, but also reveals Himself as
    Healer.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>c. </strong>
    <strong>Jehovah Nissi</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Meaning ‘The Lord our Banner or our Victor’ (Ex.17:15). This revelation
    came after God had given a great victory to Israel over the Amalekites.

    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>d. </strong>
    <strong>Jehovah Shalom </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Meaning ‘The Lord our Peace’ (Judges 6:23). The book of Ephesians 2:14
    says, Jesus is our peace; which literally means fullness of peace, the
    possession of all things necessary for one’s peace.

    <strong>f. </strong>
    <strong>Jehovah Tsidkenu</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Meaning “The Lord our Righteousness” (Jer.23:6). The righteousness that God
    demands to relate with us Jesus made it possible for us. He bore the
    penalty, shame and judgment of God in our stead. Jesus does not only ‘save’
    us; he declared us righteous before God (1Cor.1:30).

    human race was driven out from the presence of God, while Jesus who is the
    second Adam, brought us back to the presence of God.

    <strong>Jesus Christ, Our Healer</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Every blessing, including healing, comes to us through Christ from God’s
    presence. Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows (Isaiah
    53:4). One of the things mankind lost was health and strength which is
    restored through the atonement.

<p class="article"> 
    Jesus’ death on the cross met and satisfied every demand for perfect remedy

    Healing was part of Jesus’ ministry. Matt.4:23-24; 9:25; 12:15
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus Himself is our best guide to the ministry of healing. He healed when
    healing was needed to prove His divine assignment and authority over all
    circumstances. He healed to convey God’s mercy and to destroy the works of
    the devil. Phil.2:27; 1Jn.3:8

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus did not only come to show and introduce us to God’s mercy, but also
    left the healing mission for us his believers to continue where He stopped.

    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Methods Jesus Employed</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus employed different methods to heal the people in His ministry on
    earth. Let us consider briefly a few of these methods:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>a. </strong>
    <strong>He Spoke The Word Of Authority. </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Roman officer, as an army officer, was accustomed to giving and
    receiving orders. He demanded that Jesus should just “speak the word only
    and my servant shall be healed”. We also have authority in Jesus name. Mark
    11:23
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>b. </strong>
    <strong>He Laid Hands Upon The Sick. </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus had to lay hands on the sick because of their cultural background;
    people had great faith in laying on of hands. Mk.5:21-23, 6:5, Lk.4:40.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>c. </strong>
    <strong>He Rebuked Sickness. Lk.4:33-37, 38-39</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus demonstrated His power and authority over sickness and diseases.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>d. </strong>
    <strong>He Touched People. Matt.8:3, 9:29, Lk.22:51</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus expressed His compassion for the sick and manifested the glory of
    God. John 11:40; Lk.13:10-17.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>e. </strong>
    <strong>People Touched Him. Matt. 14:35-36; Mk.5:25-29.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    People demonstrated their faith in Jesus’ redemptive power to heal.

<p class="article"> 
    1. In view of the study on this lesson, discuss the practical steps in
    obtaining healing.

    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sickness entered the world when Adam fell. Sin and demonic powers still
    cause sickness today. Sickness can also come through neglect of health;
    also through aging which reduces one’s physical strength. Our heart’s
    passion for the readers is that God would grant them grace to do all that
    is necessary and give them divine healing when we are sick in Jesus name
    (Amen).

<p class="article"> 
    It is God’s will to heal. God prefers not to afflict you, He’d rather heal
    (Ps.22:24). No sickness no matter how serious it is, is difficult for God
    to heal. In order to obtain and benefit from the healing of God, you should
    begin with a clean heart; confess any unconfessed sin so that it will not
    hinder your faith to receiving healing. Prepare by memorizing promises and
    find authority in God’s word and faith will come of itself. Ask in faith,
    nothing wavering. Stand your ground in faith and trust, because real faith
    puts into action what it believes and thank God for healing and answering
    your prayer.<em></em>

    <em>
        We believe that born-again believers should be people who pray and who
        allow the Holy Spirit to shape their values and behaviours every day;
        their lives should exemplify love, honesty and sincerity (Ephesians
        4:30-32).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is good to remind ourselves that the subject matter of this lesson is
    being considered in relation to mankind and within a Christian context.
    Since the Spirit is our Enabler, the doctrine of the infilling of the Holy
    Spirit is therefore critical to fellowship with God and obedience to Him.
    Without an understanding of this doctrine, the believer cannot properly
    function in the Christian life. As a background to this lesson, we will
    consider briefly the three types of human nature that can be identified all
    around us.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>The Natural man</em>
    : - He represents everyday man, born with a very high propensity to sin.
    His "heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked ..."
    Jeremiah 17:9. Living in sin is his natural instinct.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>The Carnal man</em>
    - is a natural man who encounters Christ through the working of the Holy
    Spirit, he becomes a new man born of the Spirit. His life begins to take a
    new shape with the help of the Holy Spirit who indwells him. But to the
    extent that he easily compromises with his human nature, he remains a
    carnal man. Such is the case with many backsliders, and they are at risk of
    relapsing to the state of a natural man.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <em>The Spiritual man</em>
    - is the one, who having encountered Christ, enjoys the grace of having the
    Holy Spirit dwelling in him as well as having total control of his life to
    the extent that he yields himself continually to his counsel.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In view of this background, a spirit-filled life, the centre point of our
    lesson, will be more like the spiritual man, which our outline is out to
    address in greater details.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>
        Trouble with the Natural Person – Jer. 17: 9; Ro 5: 5; 8: 9; 1 Co 6: 19
        - 20;
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Until one is regenerated, "... the sinful nature desires what is contrary
    to the Spirit and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature ..."
    (Gal 5: 17). The natural man misses the hope which "does not disappoint"
    and "the love of God" that has been poured out in believers "hearts by the
    Holy Spirit ..." There's no love connection between him and God (Ro 5: 5).
    Little wonder therefore that he also misses the point of the function of
    his body as "the temple of the Holy Spirit ... given ... by God" who bought
    him "with a high price" so that he "must honour God" with it (1Cor 6: 19 -
    20). To this end, he becomes a victim of defilement, deformity and
    destruction - not having Christ, unsaved, spiritually dead (Eph. 2: 1), and
    alienated from the Spirit of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Commenting on Gal 5: 17, Beth Moore in <em>Living Beyond Yourself</em>
    asserts that one of human biggest reasons for failure in daily struggles is
    our vain attempt to balance the Spirit and the flesh - to make them
    function as co-workers. They can't work together because they are polar
    opposites. A natural man is a willing tool in the hands of Satan who
    operates in partnership with the world systems to promote the interest of
    their offspring - flesh.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>He's self ruled - 1 Corinthians 2: 14</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The "... natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God",
    they are" just beyond him. (1 Co 2: 14). He simply follows his heart. The
    phrase: "follow your heart" is a common one in the civilized world today,
    but it has been exported to other parts of the world. Need one be
    apologetic in saying that it has a clear expression in the life of a
    natural man? Of course, when one places it side by side with the Scriptures
    (Jer 17: 9), one can rightly guess what to expect, since it is beyond
    argument that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak.
</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">

        <strong>His life excludes Christ – Romans 8: 9; John 15: 5</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="article"> 
    “... Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (Rom
    8:9). As a self-willed individual, the natural man "... does not belong to
    Christ". He has no space for Him in the Inn - that has been occupied by the
    rudiments of the world, philosophies and traditions of men (Col. 2:6). As a
    natural man who has no connection with Christ (John 15: 5), he can only do
    NOTHING! He has "no means by which to be truly victorious over sin ... God
    expects unredeemed people to sin". This may explain why revival has nothing
    to do with unsaved people.

        </strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="article"> 
    As earlier inferred, the natural man operates in the midst of three pretty
    strong foes - the world, the devil and the flesh - real wolves! So, the
    lions are saved the trouble of "seeking whom to devour". (1 Pet 5: 8).
    Unfortunately and quite unlike the Spiritual man who is blessed with
    someone "greater in" him "than he that is in the world", the natural man
    has no such in him and therefore he is spiritually defenceless and
    incapacitated (1Jn 4: 4). Putting it another way, he stands the risk of
    eternal death because "the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead"
    does not dwell in him. Therefore, he misses the grace to have life given to
    his mortal body" to quicken it back to eternal life! (Ro 8:11, 4: 17).

    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>
        Temptations Of the Carnal Man - Eph 4: 30, 6: 18, 1Thess 5: 19
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Life is directed by Self</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
    who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”
    (Romans 8:1). It seems very clear from this scripture that being in Christ
    and walking in the Spirit are two separate issues, both of which are
    essential to living a spirit-filled life. The carnal man often derails at
    the point of various temptations posed by the world systems. Living by
    personal strength, He easily gives in to the sinful passions of the flesh.
    This could not be made any clearer than how the Holy Spirit puts it across
    through Paul that "those who live according to the flesh set their minds on
    the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the
    things of the Spirit... the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is
    not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be.” Rom 8:5-7. The only way
    of escape here will be by "being watchful to this end" and “praying always
    with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit…" (Eph 6: 18). But by the
    way a carnal man lives, he is weak in prayer, and weak enough to fail in
    his duty not to bring sorrow to God’s Holy Spirit nor "grieve the Holy
    Spirit of God". (Eph 4:30). The Spirit is grieved whenever any person
    rebels against God's word that is revealed through the Spirit, or when men
    despise the preaching of the truth or disciples disobey God. Only God knows
    how often a carnal man stifles or "quenchs the Spirit.” (I Thess 5:19). The
    Greek word used here for quench is <em>sbennumi,</em> which in this context
    means "to dampen, hinder, repress as in preventing the Holy Spirit from
    exerting His full influence". Simply put, to quench the Holy Spirit is to
    say no to God. And this is easily identifiable in the life of a carnal man.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Limited space for Jesus - John 16: 12 - 14</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Even when an individual is born again, except he or she yields totally to
    the Holy Spirit, such a person cannot have enough of Jesus to direct
    her/his life. So it's much easier for a carnal man to promote self-glory.
    Jesus operates in a believer's life through the Holy Spirit whom He had
    delegated all responsibilities to as He went to the Father. “I still have
    many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He,
    the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He
    will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak;
    and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take
    of what is Mine and declare it to you” (John 16:12 – 14). An interesting
    thing to note about the activities of a spirit filled life is that it
    glorifies Christ. This is because the Holy Spirit does not glorify Himself
    but Christ!
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>
        Triumph of the Spirit-filled Man – Eph. 3: 16, 20; 5: 18 - 21.
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    One of the essential ministries of the Holy Spirit is to grant an inner
    strength which allows a spirit-filled man to triumph over various daily
    temptations being orchestrated by the three dreadful foes (the world, the
    devil and the flesh) of the redeemed people (Eph. 3: 16, 20). That is why
    God wants every believer to be filled with the Spirit, because it is the
    only way to triumph over the lusts of the flesh and of the eyes, and the
    pride of life. But like someone said, many Christians are not sure what
    this means or what it looks like. It is believed that an attempt to help
    Ephesian believers understand that whatever fills them controls them, makes
    Paul cite drunkenness as a negative example of "filling" and quickly warns
    them to avoid it [Ephesians 5:18-21]. Every believer is indwelt by God's
    Spirit, but the extent of His rule is determined by the Christian's freedom
    to comply.
</p>
<ol start="1" type="A">
    <li>
        <strong>Longing for the Spirit - Acts 1: 1 - 5</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="article"> 
    The longing in the heart of a man to please God, followed by the right
    steps taken, can activate the fulfilment of the promise of in-filling of
    the Spirit in his life. This longing will enable him support godly plans
    which will ultimately result in victory. “And being assembled together with
    them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the
    Promise of the Father, “... you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not
    many days from now.”” (Acts 1:4-5). Of course, the result was seen “When
    the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one
    place... And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak
    with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance” (Acts 2:1-4).
</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
    <li>
        <strong>Living in the Spirit - Romans 8: 5, 11</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="article"> 
    Living in the Spirit is actually a triumph of the Spirit over the flesh!
    And it's a practice that can only be correctly associated with those who
    are responsible to the Holy Spirit (1 Co 6: 19 - 20), those who express the
    reality of Gal 2: 20 on daily basis! It's hoped that we agree that living
    and walking in the Spirit are two ways of saying the same thing. There are
    obvious advantages of walking in the Spirit which the scriptures point out.
    Besides the avoidance of the consequential pains of walking in the flesh,
    others include the righteous requirement of the law being fulfilled,
    spiritual sensitivity being optimally at work, abundant life being assured,
    and peace that passes human understanding is guaranteed. It also includes
    the advantages of physical quickening of believers’ bodies which go beyond
    now unto eternity. But here and now, perhaps as a proof that "gospel also
    includes God's care for the physical body", Holy Spirit still continues in
    the healing ministry of (quickening as it were) the dead (sick) bodies in
    honour of Christ Jesus. Healing of the deaf, the lame, the stroke patient
    and such like in our days can only confirm this further. The Spirit of God
    can still hover over every dark spot around us to restore hope! (Gen 1: 2).
    Living by the Spirit provides believers in Christ with the opportunity to
    access the immense benefits in the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is equally important to know that one of the essential ministries of the
    Holy Spirit to believers is the sealing, and this is seen in the context of
    Eph 4: 30. The Greek word used for seal here is <em>sphragizo</em> and it
    has two-fold meaning. Firstly, to seal is to "close up and make fast with a
    seal signet such as letters or books so that they may not be read" by
    unauthorized persons. Secondly, it means "to set seal or a mark upon a
    thing as a token of its authenticity or approvedness". In this context
    therefore, the seal of the Holy Spirit is for protection and identification
    - believers are identified as joint heirs with Christ, whose lives are
    protected against any intruders.

        Leading of the Spirit - Romans 8: 14; Matthew 4: 1; Luke 4: 1;
        Galatians 2: 20; 1 John 4: 4; John 16: 33;
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Like Beth Moore puts it: "Every time you realize God has somehow pricked
    your heart to discern direction, the Holy Spirit has manifested Himself
    through leadership." Let us sum up the secret of the triumph of a spiritual
    man thus: The spiritual man is the person in which the mind of Christ is
    activated. He or she is a person who delights in the meat of God and not
    just the milk. His/her mind is open to those things which "no eye has seen,
    nor ear has heard, no mind has conceived.” The spiritual man lives and
    thinks in a capacity far beyond that of a mere man. Leading of the spirit
    in a spirit-filled life is a perfect function of yieldedness. Moore further
    expressed that "the issue of spirituality rests upon yieldedness to the
    Holy Spirit's control. Spiritual life will never come naturally." It's only
    in the matter of sin nature that you don't make any conscious choice to
    sin, because it comes naturally.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Beloved fellow pilgrims, because "those who are in the flesh cannot please
    God", living in the Spirit has no acceptable alternative for us. (Rom 8:
    8). It is therefore a necessity for every heavenly-bound believer in Christ
    to “... Walk in the Spirit, ... For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and
    the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so
    that you do not do the thing that you wish" (Gal 5:16-17). In the counsel
    of Paul's passionate appeal to the Galatians Church, fellow believers in
    Christ must "live according to the direction of God's word" in order to
    "bring their lives into harmony with the direction of the Spirit" (Dickson
    pg. 1535).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is in a spirit filled life that one can boast of being led to know and
    grow in God, and being empowered to fight victoriously the life's
    inevitable battles with the world, the flesh, and the devil. In every way
    and at every turn, we are utterly dependent on the Holy Spirit of God.

    Natural persons have no means by which to be truly victorious over sin.
    They are driven solely by their own nature. We should not be surprised at
    the depravity that surrounds us. God no doubt wills us to "grow in the
    knowledge" of the Lord Jesus Christ, that we may be thoroughly furnished.
    Yet, the issue of spirituality rests upon yieldedness to the Holy Spirit’s
    control. It must be understood that it is always a result of deliberate
    choice to yield, to consciously surrender. The spiritual life will never
    come naturally. Surrender must be a daily choice. We can be spiritual one
    day and not the next, or even in the morning and not in the night that
    follows. We are spiritual when we are out of control and the Holy Spirit is
    in control. Beloved, God longs to pour out His blessings upon every
    believer who will not quench the Holy Spirit: by saying yes to God, nor
    grieve the Holy Spirit: by saying no to sin.

<p class="article"> 
    <em>
        We believe that born-again believers should be people who pray and who
        allow the Holy Spirit to shape their values and behaviours every day;
        their lives should exemplify love, honesty and sincerity (Ephesians
        4:30-32).
    </em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Just like the Bible says, there are diverse kinds of the gifts of the
    Spirit, with visible benefits to the Church. Therefore, manifestation of
    the gifts of the Holy Spirit is a normal expectation in a spirit filled
    life. However, the evidence of the Spirit's control is revealed better in
    the people of character. The manifestation of the gift of the spirit would
    most likely promote charisma in individuals, but it is only in a person of
    character that the fruit of the spirit becomes visible. It therefore seems
    to suggest that manifestation of the fruit of the spirit serves a better
    measure of a spirit-filled life. I believe that Paul was in the process of
    giving very specific instructions about the purpose and practice of the
    gifts of the Spirit which were being abused in the Corinthian Church when
    he penned down 1 Corinthians 13.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The people of Corinth loved philosophy and listened all the more if it was
    presented with depth and colour - they might have even considered a
    discourse most impressive if they couldn’t comprehend a single word of it.
    They were more often interested in the expression of language than its
    content. But Paul admitted that he did not come before them with great
    polish and fluency. We can imagine the shock of their lives. Paul,
    responding further to their obsession with words said: “If I speak in the
    tongues of men and of angels, but have not love”, my words will be
    meaningless noise. He then went on to refer to the spiritual gifts of
    prophecy, knowledge, and faith, which were proudly being misused.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Charisma in the Spirit filled Life</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    If we agree that every believer is indwelt by God's Spirit, we must also
    realize that the extent of His rule is determined by the extent to which
    each exercises his freedom to comply with the demands of the Spirit in him.
    Think of this as a voluntary choice to surrender your life to the Holy
    Spirit's control—in other words, to be sensitive and submissive to His
    leadership and guidance, obedient to His promptings, and dependent upon His
    strength. The degree of surrender determines the level of transformation.
    And those who have yielded their lives to His leadership are continually
    being transformed into His likeness.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>A Case for Charisma</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Charisma may seem like affluence, charm and having an “anointing” or
    energetic personality. It is often mistaken as a character trait. Perhaps
    this explains why people who function in such screaming spiritual gifts
    like healings, works of miracle or eloquence draw a lot of crowd to
    themselves. Their influence on people can be quite electrifying. Being
    charismatic is not necessarily a bad idea. It is only when it is devoid of
    character that it loses value. As a matter of fact, combining charisma with
    character has been considered invaluable assets in most human endeavours,
    spiritual inclusive.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Limitation of Charisma<em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Granted that spiritual gifts manifest themselves in different ways, one
    must nevertheless not understand the diversity of the function of the gifts
    in a way that would undermine the supremacy or oneness of God. Miraculous
    gifts were not given for the purpose of self-exaltation as the Corinthian
    believers were conducting themselves with one another. They were given for
    the benefit of edification – Rom 12: 6 – 8. The very purpose for which the
    gifts were given was based on serving the needs of others. Believers must
    not fall into Corinthian mode of using for self-exaltation what God has
    given for the purpose of administering service to others. This requires one
    yielding to the Holy Spirit, an area where charismatic personalities are
    often deficient. Even though good works and faithful service are a result
    of being filled with the Spirit, they are not necessarily signs of it. When
    we talk about what we do, that is about charisma. How much noise do we hear
    around us today, which may lack the presence of God! 1 Kings 19: 11 - 13.
    "Charisma doesn't ... impress God", if it impresses you, be careful (Rick
    Warren).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is Swindoll who maintains that if you get involved in a ministry that
    glorifies itself, instead of Christ, the Spirit of God is not in that
    ministry. If you follow a leader that is getting the glory for that
    ministry, instead of Christ, the Spirit of God isn’t empowering his
    leadership. If you’re a part of a Christian school or mission organization
    or a Christian camping ministry in which someone other than Christ is being
    glorified, it is not being empowered by the Spirit of God. Mark it down:
    THE SPIRIT GLORIFIES CHRIST.

    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Character in the Spirit filled Life</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Spirit-Controlled Life Produces Character</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The key to rightly living the Christian life is being controlled by the
    Holy Spirit, who provides energy for walking "worthy of the calling with
    which you have been called" (Eph. 4:1). Unless you are controlled by the
    Spirit of God, you can never walk in humility, love, unity, light, and
    wisdom. The life of God in the soul of man is the only way anyone can live
    a righteous life. To walk without the Spirit is to walk without wisdom (cf.
    Eph. 5:15 -17) and by inference, without character.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It's easier to function in the areas of some giftedness than to love the
    unlovable or be patient with difficult people. How do you feel seeing a
    professed believer in Christ who says all the right things but his
    personality but the life he lives seem disgustingly at variance! This is
    where lines are drawn between charisma and character.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Distinctive of the Fruit of the Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The most distinguishing factor between a man of character and that of
    charisma is the evidence of the fruit of the Spirit. Beth Moore defines
    this fruit as: “the supernatural outcome of being filled with the Spirit or
    the living proof that the Spirit of God dwells in us”. Gal 5: 22 – 23 and
    1Cor 13: 4 – 8 seem to be in agreement on the matter of the fruit and its
    qualities. Since it is “by their fruits” (Mat 7: 16, 20) we will know those
    who are truly led by the Holy Spirit, it becomes easier for us to
    understand why a man of character exhibits much more naturally the fruit of
    the Spirit.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Of course, the Spirit is believers’ Helper, producing in us the fruits that
    make us people of character.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    No wonder therefore that the doctrine of the infilling of the Holy Spirit
    is critical to fellowship with God in obedience, without which the believer
    cannot properly function in the Christian life.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The necessity of a proper understanding of the filling/controlling ministry
    of the Spirit is amplified by Paul's prayer in Gal 4: 19, "My children—I am
    again undergoing birth pains until Christ is formed in you!” Included in
    the meaning of the Greek word translated “formed” (<em>morfow</em>) is the
    concept of giving outward expression of inward character. The form means
    the essential form rather than outward shape. The idea is therefore of real
    Christ-like character." It is about Christ being outwardly expressed in the
    believer, from within through the power of the Spirit. Mere external
    conformity is not the goal. We must note also that the verb “formed” is
    passive. This means the subject receives the action rather than produces
    the action.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Rick Warren’s view, the maturity we need for our Christian service is
    not about skills alone. It's also about character. And the maturity of
    character is not about age, it's not about appearance, it's not about
    achievements, nor about mere academics. It's about attitude - character!
    That is the determining factor of spiritual maturity. Character is the
    habitual ways we respond to the situations of life. It is not reputation.
    Reputation is what other people think you are, but character is what you
    really are. D. L. Moody believes that "Character is who you are in the
    dark." Character is who you are when nobody's looking. Character is who you
    are when you're not on stage. Character is the real you. And God knows your
    character. Character is something that you have and something that you are.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Excellency of Character over Charisma</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Agape (unconditional love) as the fruit of the Spirit brings to the fore
    front the beauty of living a spirit-filled life. It produces character
    which manifests itself in different forms - Gal 5: 22 - 23. Of course, the
    way of love is more excellent than the function of miraculous gifts. Love
    is more excellent than prophecy, languages or healings. According to Paul’s
    counsel to the Corinthian believers, they should be striving after love
    instead of competing over the use of their gifts. Paul seems to be telling
    them (and indeed all believers) that their goal for the church should be to
    grow beyond the ministry of miraculous gifts, to where each member can
    become a servant to other members in the spirit of love. When a closer look
    is taken at the Greek word used for love in 1 Cor 13 and its
    characteristics as presented by Paul to the Corinthians, unconditional love
    (agape) becomes quite a useful premise for us to examine the excellence of
    character over charisma. In contrast to <em>philos</em>, <em>agape</em> is
    not a feeling or relationship based on common interests. It is always
    propelled by the highest interest. Two individuals can agree on something
    (as Pilate and Herod did) and both be wrong. In contrast, agape always
    flows from what is right and best, it is not as much a feeling as it is a
    response. When God commands man to ‘agape’, this is not towards a feeling
    but to surrender to an act of His Spirit which results in obedience.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The fact that agape is not fuelled by the desire of its recipient, but by
    the need of others makes character its most distinguishing feature. It is
    patient, kind, does not envy, not boast, not proud, not rude, not
    self-seeking, not easily angered, keeps no record of wrongs, does not
    delight in evil but rejoices with the truth, always protects, always trust,
    always hopes, always perseveres, and never fails. These are often either
    non-existent or in short supplies in the life of a man of charisma.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    So often, we tend to run off to do this or that in our own steam because we
    are all so prone to trust in our own resources. The truth is because of
    human weakness, no one can live the Christian life any more than one can
    perfectly keep the Law of Moses (Rom 3: 9 -20; Gal 3: 10-14). There is no
    aspect of the Christian life, Bible study, prayer, witnessing, growth,
    etc., that is not vitally dependent on the enabling ministry of the Holy
    Spirit of God. Though God gives us spiritual gifts and a new capacity for
    life through the Spirit’s work of regeneration, it is the Holy Spirit, as
    our divine Enabler, who empowers our lives for both worship and service.
    When the Spirit is in charge of our lives, He does through us what we
    cannot do for ourselves. Each believer decides who rules his life, by
    either actively surrendering to Christ or deliberately going his own way.
    It may be said that the fullness of the Spirit and godly character await
    those who choose God over self.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Someone with a lot of charisma usually requires attention and recognition.
    When charisma is present but there is a lack of character, the charismatic
    person must feed on the praise of others to feel important. Such a person
    must put on the cloak of charisma to be liked, upheld and regarded as one
    of importance. Charisma can easily be a cover for a lack of character.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The person of character is contented to live behind the scenes and be
    effective without being noticed by others. Character is the substance of
    the person, but charisma is the magnetic appeal or draw of a message. We
    must note that there are people of tremendous character who speak or
    minister and also communicate with charisma. This doesn't necessarily
    disqualify them from being people of character.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When you hear a message, a speech, a sermon, a radio broadcast, a
    television interview, etc., don’t turn off your discernment filter. Get
    past the charismatic delivery and really look at the content of the message
    and the character of the one who is speaking. This sounds like a Berean
    Christian model, and it still works! We cannot afford to become callous or
    numb and fail to guard our hearts diligently as wisdom commands us to
    (Prov. 4:23).

<p class="article"> 
    The following qualities are expected to be found in the people of
    character. They may even be seen through the lens of charisma:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Integrity, Faithfulness, Honour, Upstanding reputation, Deeds/actions that
    are pure and right, evidence of the fruit of the Spirit in words and
    actions (Galatians 5:22), one who searches Scripture to see if something is
    true (Acts 17:11), those with clean hands and pure hearts, who don’t make
    vanity the purpose of their lives or swear oaths just to deceive (Ps
    24:4-6), those whose word can be trusted (1 Tim 3:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Urge the students to seek to be those whose reputation, worthiness and
    honour is based upon the character of their lives, not the charisma of
    their words. You may also consider the possibility of the loss of character
    in the following circumstances: 1 Corinthians 15:33, Proverbs 27:17. Just
    as iron sharpens iron, a person sharpens the character of his friend.
    Romans 5:4 "... endurance produces character, and character produces hope;”
    Ephesians 3:14, 15 "...For this reason, I fall on my knees before the
    Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its
    character.”

        Just like it was with the Corinthian church in the first century, there
        are misunderstandings about the gifts of the Spirit in 21<sup>st</sup>
        century church (I Cor. 12:1). For the church take full advantage of the
        endowments of the Holy Spirit, it is important for believers to be
        constantly reacquainted with the distinctive and purpose of these gifts
        so that each person may serve the church in the capacity in which God
        has placed him or her and that there may be no mix-up and breakup in
        the body of Christ. This is exactly the emphasis of this lesson. Also,
        it is important to establish the link between the fruit and the gifts
        of the Spirit.

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Designation of the Gifts</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The gifts of the Holy Spirit are those supernatural abilities bestowed on
    Christians for special services in body of Christ. The three texts of this
    lesson delineate specific gifts that God's Spirit gives to Christians.
    Basically, they are distinctive, divinely originated endowments to serve
    the Triune God for the common benefit of his people, the church (Rom
    12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:7; Eph. 4:12-13). In Pauline theology, a spiritual gift
    is essentially an act of God’s Spirit, a concrete manifestation of God’s
    grace through an individual for the benefits of others. It is observable
    that the lists of spiritual gifts demonstrate significant overlap as well
    as important variations. This indicates that none of the lists, taken
    either individually or collectively, is intended to be comprehensive.
    Rather each is suggestive of the diversity of ways God endows Christians
    for spiritual service. Broader classifications may therefore suggest other
    gifts not specifically listed. It is important to note that in Paul’s
    thought, all believers are bearers of God’s graces. Anyone open to and is
    led by the Spirit (Rom. 8:14), will inexorably manifest the grace of God in
    some way, expressing the power of God in particular words and deeds within
    the community of faith.
</p>

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Distinctives of the Gifts</strong>
    (I Cor. 12:1-11)<strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Significantly, it is important to note that the dynamics, administrations
    and operations of the gifts are diverse and are the outworking of the
    Godhead (I Cor. 12:4-6). What this means is that:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. There are different kinds of gifts. The gifts Paul listed in I Cor.
    12:7-10, Rom 12:6-8 and Ephesians 4:11-15 are not necessarily exhaustive
    and some of them even overlap. A comparison of these texts reveals that
    Paul was not out to give a comprehensive list, but a selective example
    relevant to his purpose.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. Just as there are varieties of gifts, the gifts has different purposes
    and functions. For example, Peter was an apostle, just as Paul was an
    apostle, but Paul’s apostolic work was targeted at the gentiles.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c. The gifts are of divine origin. They are generally designated as graces
    (<em>charismata) </em>of the Spirit<em>. </em>This signifies that the gifts
    are not the products of human efforts or institutional investiture. In
    other words the manifestation of any of the gifts does not require any
    human embellishment to validate it as being divine. It is not a talent
    show. It does not have to be ecstatic to be charismatic. Similarly, it is
    not the church’s appointment or ordination that confers gifts on believers.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d. The distribution of the gifts is sovereign. The Holy Spirit distributes
    to each one as He wills, a gift to a particular person and another to
    someone else. This means that no one person receives all the gifts and no
    one gift is imparted to all.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    e. The gifts are given for the common benefits of the church and not for
    selfish advantage, personal significance or exclusive profit. All the gifts
    are intended to build up the members of the body of Christ, for the work
    ministry. The leadership gifts as highlighted in Ephesians 4:11-12 are
    specifically meant to equip the believers, for the work of ministry.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    f. The diversity of the gifts and the unity of their source, is symbolic of
    the Church’s concept of unity in diversity as illustrated with the human
    body by Paul in Romans 12:4-5 and Ephesians 4:7-8. To the extent that the
    various gifts are from one Source, they are meant to foster the growth and
    unity of the church. The gifts are therefore to be complementary and not
    competitive in unifying the church. The less visible or recognized gifts
    are as important as the more visible or recognized ones. There should not
    be any undue overemphasis of one over the other. Just as the physical body
    functions well only when each part is healthy and working well in unity, so
    also with the gifts of the Spirit in the body of Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    g. Finally, the outworking of the gifts is Christocentric. Jesus Christ is
    head of the Church and distributor of all gifts of the Spirit (Eph. 4: 11).
    He distributes gifts from the fullness that he himself possesses, as the
    result of his incarnation and exaltation (Eph. 4: 8). From Christ’s
    fullness of the Spirit believers receive a measure “as Christ apportioned
    it” (Eph. 4:7). The gifts enable believers to fulfil the mission of Christ,
    as they are particularly capable of leading people to faith in Christ, as
    believers themselves are being groomed and grounded in the knowledge of
    Christ, maturing to become like Him (Ephesian 4:13). The indwelling of the
    Spirit and manifestation of the gifts in the believer’s life affirm and
    extol the Lordship of Christ (1Cor. 12:3).

    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life application.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The nature of the church requires its members to recognize their respective
    capabilities and to begin functioning in the areas of their particular
    ministries. Just as the physical body is one organism having many parts,
    each one with their respective functions, which operate in different
    manners, but at the same time in harmony and unity, so is the Body of
    Christ, the Church; unity in the midst of diversity. If the Church is going
    to function as an organism, then it is necessary for the members to
    minister or serve one another faithfully with all the capabilities that the
    Holy Spirit has given to each one (Ephesians 4:16).

<p class="article"> 
    It is very important to acknowledge that the list of gifts provided in the
    New Testament, in Pauline writings and elsewhere are not conclusive and
    they overlap. This is to correct the notion that the spiritual gifts are
    limited to the nine in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 or the leadership gifts in
    Ephesians 4:11. Just as there are variety of gifts and functions, there are
    also variety of classifications, depending on the location where the gifts
    are in use, the period in the history of the Church, the perspective of a
    church tradition or denomination and a number of other reasons. However
    based on the texts of this study, we may categorize the gifts as follows:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Gifts of Inspired Speech: Prophecy or Prophesying, Tongues and
    Interpretation, Teaching, Exhorting
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. Gifts of Inspired Knowledge: Word of Wisdom and Knowledge, Discernment
    of spirits
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3. Gifts of Inspired Action: Faith, Healing, Miracles
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4. Gifts of Service: Serving, Giving, Care (showing mercy), Administration
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5. Gifts of Leadership: Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Pastors, and
    Evangelists
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The principle of the diversity of functions applies in interpreting or
    understanding the functions, intensity and variations of some of these
    gifts during the apostolic age as contrasted with their applications in
    today’s church. For example, the gifts of Apostles and prophets in the
    first century were foundational to the life of the Church (Eph. 2:20).
    Obviously, these gifts do not have the same dimension of operation today.

        As Paul discussed the gifts of the Spirit, he suddenly changes his
        focus to ‘love’ as being the “most excellent way” of obtaining the
        gifts. What is the reason for this sudden change? Why is love the most

    <strong>Lesson Commentary.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
I.    <strong>Relationship between the gifts and the fruit of the Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The first part of 1 Corinthians12:31 reads, “But eagerly desire the greater
    gifts.” (NIV) Some Biblical scholars, have suggested that this verse should
    be read affirmatively, “You earnestly contend about the best gifts; but I
    show unto you a more excellent way. This is a likely reading, given the
    fact that Corinthian church was very contentious about the gifts than about
    the fruit of the Spirit. Earlier, Paul refused to recognize certain
    charismatics in the church as spiritual, because their gifts, not
    accompanied by love, had become distorted by jealousy, strife, arrogance
    and false wisdom (1 Cor. 3:1-3). Love (<em>agape</em>) as used here is not
    a human attribute, but the work or fruit of the Spirit. Love embeds the
    other characteristics or kinds of the fruit of the Spirit as Paul
    highlighted in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 and Galatians 5:22-23. The principle
    Paul establishes here is that without love the gifts do not profit the
    recipients (13:1-3). Love is the context in which the gifts have their full
    effectiveness. Elsewhere, in his teaching, Paul showed the relationship
    between the gifts and the fruit of the Spirit, essentially, love Rom.
    12:6-9; Eph. 4:2, 7-11, 15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    II. <strong>Preeminence of the fruit of the Spirit</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    No doubt, the gifts of the Spirit are essential for the Church,
    nevertheless Paul gives the fruit of the Spirit a certain preeminence as 1
    Corinthians shows. The following reasons may be adduced for the Apostle
    emphasis on the matter:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a. The fruit represents the Character of Christ (in his epistles Paul
    associates Christ with love. He interchangeably speaks of putting on love
    or Christ— Col. 3:14; Rom.13:14; or of being rooted in love or in Christ—
    Col. 2:7; Eph. 3:17), while the gifts manifest particular ministries of
    Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b. The fruit will abide eternally in the personality of the redeemed, while
    the gifts are bestowed only in part and for the mission of the Church in
    this present age.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c. The fruit of the Spirit is what all Christians have or should have in
    common. The gifts, on the other hand, represent a diversity in which one
    believer’s gift may not be fully understood or appreciated by another. The
    gifts can bring about unity of the body, only when they are used to
    complement one another. The fruit, however is the undergirding, common
    factor that enables the gifts to be used in this manner.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d. The expression of the fruit and not the manifestation of the gifts of
    the Spirit determines the spirituality or spiritual status of the
    Christian. Paul did not recognize the highly gifted Corinthian church as
    spiritual because they were lacking in the fruit of the Spirit. Whenever
    Christians are more impressed with dramatic gifts rather than authentic
    fruit, there are major problems. We need to always keep in mind Jesus’
    warning, “You shall know them by their fruit.” (Matt. 7:20) He did not say,
    “You shall know them by their gifts.” Basically, the gifts are unrelated to
    maturity of the believer in the ‘growth of grace’. They do not primarily
    arise out of an inward life, but the sovereign act of the great Giver.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>e. </strong>
    Where love abounds, decency and order will pervade the manifestation and
    demonstration of the gifts in the community of the Spirit (I Corinthians
    14:32-33). Where there is no love, chaos abounds (13:1b).<strong></strong>

    <strong>Questions &amp; Discussion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1. Some argue that some gifts like tongues and working of miracles have
    ceased with the apostolic age, what do you think?
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2. How does the fruit of Spirit reinforce the unity of the body of Christ,
    as its members manifest the spiritual gifts?

    <strong>Life Application.</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Understanding the relationship between spiritual gifts and the fruit of the
    Spirit, gives us the wisdom to balance our walk with God and our work for
    God through our gifts. Love for God and for God’s people, commits us to a
    deeper and sincere relationship with Christ and with other Christians (Rom
    12:9-10), as we earnestly desire to see the Church become more strengthened
    and Christ glorified as we show forth our gifts.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As we have learnt the gifts are given as the Spirit determines (v. 11). One
    may seek and pray for certain gifts (1 Cor. 14:1, 12), but God makes no
    guarantees of giving any one particular gift as requested, as His
    sovereignty supersedes our desires. All the gifts are valuable to the
    building up of the church; none may be discounted as nonessential (vv.
    14-26). There is a ranking of gifts (vv. 27-28) but the sequence is more of
    chronology than of priority<strong>. </strong>There is no scriptural
    grounds for the claim in some circles that any of the gifts have ceased.
They are God's characteristic endowments for Christian service in    <strong> </strong>the New Testament age, although there may be variations
    in intensity and functions as applied to the Church of today. Against the
    view that maintains, from the lack of the more<strong> </strong>
    supernatural gifts throughout much of church history, that these graces
    were limited to the apostolic age, three points must be noted: (1) these
    gifts did not end at the<strong> </strong>close of the first century, but
    continued well into the third; (2) their subsequent diminution can best be
attributed to a growing, unscriptural institutionalization of the church    <strong> </strong>and an overreaction to the abuse of the gifts in
    heretical (most notably Montanist) circles; (3) even then, no era of church
    history was completely without examples of all the<strong> </strong>gifts.

        We believe that the second coming of Christ is personal and imminent;
        we are as certain that His second coming will occur as we are that His
        first coming is a historical fact. No one knows the exact time of His
        coming, but believers will continue to spread the gospel around the
        world until He does come again. At that time the Lord Himself will
        descend from heaven, the dead Christians will be resurrected, and
        believers will be taken up to meet the Lord in the air (Matthew 24:36,
        42, 44; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17).
    </em>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Biblical teaching of the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ is one
    of the four cardinal proclamations of the Foursquare Gospel that we believe
    and expect.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus took time to teach his disciples that they believed it to the extent
    that they thought it was going to happen soon after the Ascension. Hence
    they adopted the form of greetings MARANATHA- a Greek word meaning the Lord
    is coming. Beloved, God has His time table. From eternity past i.e. (a
    beginning that has no beginning that God has been in existence) to eternity
    future (i.e. an end that has no end) there are four global events that
    moved God from heaven to the planet earth to intervene in the affairs of
    the earth. These four events are:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. The creation of the Earth (Gen. 1:1,2)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. The birth of Jesus Christ (Mat. 1:18-25)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iii. The death, resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ (Mat.27: 32-
    28:20; Acts 1:1-11)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iv. The second coming of Jesus Christ (1Thess. 4:13:18)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Three of the events have already taken place and the next and final one is
    the second coming of Christ.
    <strong>
        <em>
            For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but Holy
            men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost (2Pet. 1:21).

    <strong>Biblical Prophecies</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Biblical prophecies were utterances by men of God who were moved to speak
    by the Holy Spirit, messages that the Almighty God has for His people. At
    times they are very clear and precise and at other times they are coded and
    need interpretation through the Spirit of God. “For the prophecy came not
    in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were
    moved by the Holy Ghost” (2Peter 1:21).

    <strong>Prophecies of His First Coming</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    There were many prophecies concerning the first coming of our Lord Jesus
    Christ in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments. These were given
    by many prophets who lived at different times and many of them who didn't
    know one another. They were able to prophesy almost precisely, time of His
    birth, the tribe He should come from, the name that would be given Him, the
    suffering He would pass through, type of death, His resurrection as well as
    His ascension to heaven. Here are a few of these prophecies and their
    fulfilment:

    The second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot be disputed as we have
    studied from the Bible passages above. Consequently, it is necessary for
    everyone to believe this fact of the scriptures and get ourselves ready to
    receive Him. We should remember the parable of the ten virgins, five were
    wise - they took enough oil in their lamps and had extra oil in case the
    Bridegroom tarried - while five were foolish- they had oil in their lamps
    but did not take extra. The wise virgins were prepared when He eventually
    came, they went with Him but the foolish virgins were left behind.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    All of us who have received Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour must
    constantly examine our spiritual lives, remain true to our faith, since His
    coming will be sudden. We must be dedicated and committed to daily
    Christian living that is free from all entanglements that can prevent us
    from going with Him.

<p class="article"> 
    When the earthly ministry of Jesus was coming to an end, He gave several
    exhortations with promises of His coming back to comfort the disciples.
    When Jesus said, Trust in God; trust also in Me (John 14:1), He was
    probably giving commands, not making statements. Death should not be a
    terror to them (believers) because Jesus was leaving to prepare a place for
    them in heaven, the Father's house. He declared his coming back to the
    Rapture of the church when Christ will return for His sheep (1 Thess.
    4:13-18) and they will be with Him forever (John 17:24). Jesus said nothing
    about the nature of the place where He was going. It is sufficient that
    believers will be with the Father and Jesus (2 Cor. 5:8; Phil 1:23; 1
    Thess. 4:17).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The disciples knew how to get to heaven. He told them, You know the way to
    the place where I am going. Throughout His ministry, Jesus had been showing
    them the way. Jesus' words, “I am the Way and the Truth and the Life …”
    (John 14:6), should be a motivating force for us to prepare our ways before
    God and also to be more aggressive in evangelism and soul winning. With
    events around the world, we have more than enough signs of the close of the
    age. Are you prepared to meet the LORD?<strong></strong>

    <strong>Meaning Of The Rapture </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The word is not in the Bible but came from the Latin word "rapere" which
    means to be caught up. It also means to snatch away. It refers to the
    sudden appearance of Jesus Christ in the air to take away the believers to
    heaven. Scriptures where taught include- John 14:1-3; 1Thess.4:13-18; 1Cor.
    15 : 51-58; 2Cor. 5: 1,2; 1 Thess. 2: 19; 1Thess. 3:13; 1Thess.5: 23; Col.
    3: 4; 1John. 2:28; 1John 3:2; 1Pet. 5:4; James 5:8.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>Old Testament Type Of Rapture</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. ENOCH: The Bible says Enoch walked with God and he was no more i.e. He
    was taken away (Gen. 5:24).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. ELIJAH: The prophet Elijah was carried away to heaven with a chariot of
    fire and Elisha saw him (2Kings 2:11-12).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>C. </strong>
    <strong>The Purpose Of The Rapture</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i. To bring an end to the government of the world.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii. To receive the saints unto Himself as He has promised (1Thess.4:17;
    John 14:1-3; Eph. 5:27).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iii. To resurrect the dead in Christ from among those who died as
    unbelievers (1Thess. 4:14, 16,17).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iv. To change the bodies of Christians from mortality to immortality
    (1Thess.4:16,17; 1Cor. 15:35-58; Phil 3:21).
</p>

    v. To take the saints to heaven to live in the new Jerusalem to receive

    <strong>D. </strong>
    <strong>The Nature Of The Rapture</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a) It will be sudden like the speed of lightning (Matt. 24: 31-44; 1Cor.
    15:52; Zechariah 9:14).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b) Only those saints that are expecting His coming will be raptured
    (2Tim.4:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c) It will happen secretly. People will just see that a lot of people
    throughout are missing and this will be reported by various media houses.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d) There will be a lot of chaos on earth giving room for the Great
    Tribulation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>E. </strong>
    <strong>Events In Heaven</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a) Believers will appear before the Judgement seat of Christ. This is not
    going to be a judgement of condemnation but of awarding rewards for work
    done on earth. There is therefore no condemnation to them that are in
    Christ Jesus... (Rom .8:1; John 5:22; Rom.14:12; 1Cor. 3:12-15; 2Tim.4:8;
    Matt. 12:36,37; Mark 4:22; Rom.2:5-11, 16; 1 Cor. 4:5).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b) Faithful and hardworking believers shall receive good rewards for their
    deeds (Matt. 5:11-12, 25:14-23; Luke 19 :12-19, 22:28-30; Gal.6: 8-10;
    1Cor.3:12-1; 9: 25-27; Eph.6:8).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c) Less faithful and lazy ones will not be condemned but will receive
    little or no reward (Eccl.12:14; Mat.5:19; 2Cor. 5:10; Col.3:25; 1John
    2:28).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>F. </strong>
    <strong>Events On Earth </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    While believers who have been raptured will be enjoying with the Lord in
    the air, the following events will be taking place simultaneously on the
    earth-
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>The Great Tribulation</strong>
    (Mat.24:21, 29) also described as the day of the Lord (Isa. 2:12, 13:6,9),
    the day of God’s vengeance (Isa 34:8, 63:16), etc. The nature and severity
    of the tribulation is described in the following scriptures (Isa.13:6-11,
    34:2-4, 63:3-6; Mat. 24.7-11, 12, 21, 22; Luke 21:25, 26; 1Thess. 5:2-3;
    Rev. 6: 12:17). <strong>The suffering will be so much</strong>. It shall be
    marked the rising of the <strong>Antichrist</strong> who shall command the
    receipt of the <strong>mark 666 </strong>without which one will not be able
    to buy anything from the market. Those who refuse the mark will be killed.
    These ones are referred to as Tribulation Saints.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>G. </strong>
    <strong>Qualifications For The Rapture</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    a) One must be born again and be in Christ (John 3:3-5; 1 Thess. 4:14-16;
    2Cor. 5:17-18; Gal. 5:24).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    b) One must be in the church (1Cor.12:13; Eph.1:20-23, 4:4-6; Col.1:18).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    c) One must be holy and pure in heart (Heb. 12:14; Rev.20:4-6; 1John
    3:2-3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    d) We must be without spot or wrinkle (Eph.5:27).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>A. </strong>
    <strong>Meaning of the Revelation </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This is the coming of Jesus with His Saints that had earlier been raptured
    to the planet earth. He will come to rule in power and glory for a period
    of one thousand years. He will defeat the Antichrist and the wicked
    nations. This is what is referred to as the millennial reign of Christ. The
    steps include-
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    i). The heaven is opened and Christ appears riding on a white horse with a
    crown on His head and with garments dipped in blood. His name is announced
    to be "The Word of God".
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    ii). He is accompanied by armies of saints also riding on white horses. A
    sharp sword issues from His mouth to smite the wicked nations. His title is
    revealed to be "King of Kings and Lord of Lords”.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iii). An angel announces His readiness for battle against the Beast, the
    false prophet and all those who have taken the mark of the Beast or
    worshipped his image are cast into the lake of fire (vv 19-21; Dan. 8:25).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    iv). An angel from heaven casts Satan, called "the old serpent", the
    "dragon" and the "devil", into the bottomless pit where he is imprisoned
    for the thousand years of Christ’s millennial reign (Rev.20:1-3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    v). The tribulation saints are raised and together with the church saints
    reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4; Mat. 25:21; 2 Tim. 2:12;
    Rev. 5:9, 10).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>B. </strong>
    <strong>The Purpose Of The Revelation </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As stated above, the revelation is to establish the millennial reign of
    Christ and to prepare for the final judgement (Rev.19: 11, 22:15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <br/>
    <strong>Conclusion </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2Peter 3:11 says, “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved,
    what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
    godliness.”

<p class="article"> 
    Christians who die are said to fall asleep. The figure of sleep for death
    is common in the New Testament (cf. Mark 5:39; John 11:11). This is not
    sleep of the soul, however, because Paul wrote elsewhere that a Christian
    who is absent from his body is present with the Lord (2Cor. 5:8; cf. Phil
    1:23; 1 Thess. 5:10). It is rather the "sleep" of the body in the earth
    until it is resurrected, changed into a glorious body, and reunited with
    the soul (1Cor. 15:35-57; 2Cor. 5:1-9).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Paul wanted the Thessalonians as well as Christians today to be neither
    ignorant nor grieving like the rest of men, that is, like unbelievers, over
    the death of fellow believers (1 Thess. 4:14-16). Two reasons why
    Christians should not grieve like unbelievers are that Christians have a
    revelation from God that gives them hope and they have a glorious future
    with Christ. Just as certainly as Jesus died and was resurrected by the
    Father, so God will unite the resurrected dead in Christ with their Saviour
    at His coming.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are among the best-attested
    facts of history. Since Christians know these events took place, they can
    be equally certain, Paul said, that the souls of believers who have died
    will return with Christ when He comes for His living saints. The prophecy
    of the Rapture is as sure to be fulfilled as the prophecies of Christ's
    death and resurrection.<strong></strong>

        By the grace of God so much have been revealed to us on the second
        coming of our Lord Jesus Christ from the Scriptures. We have seen the
        many prophecies and promises of His coming as well as the parables He
        gave concerning this. We have also studied the manner in which He will
        come. Today, we shall consider the signs and events that will precede
        His coming.

<p class="article"> 
    In answer to questions put to Jesus by His disciples, Jesus revealed a
    number of signs of coming events which are in three categories.
    <br/>
    (1) Those that will happen in the first century
    <br/>
    (2) Those that will happen during the church age
    <br/>
    (3) Those that will happen just before and during His coming in power and
    glory.

    Some world conditions proposed by prophetic scholars include:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>1) </strong>
    <strong>The Re-gathering of Israel in Palestine: </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    From the time of Moses, God predicted He would punish Israel for
    disobedience by scattering them throughout all nations(Deut.28:64) and that
    He would re-gather them out of all the nations bringing them back to their
    land(Deut.30:3; Isa.11:11-16, 2:2-3;Ezek.36:8, 21; 37:11,12, 38:8). Jesus
    in Luke 21-24 said, “And they (referring to Israel) shall fall by the edge
    of the sword and shall be led away captive unto all nations, and Jerusalem
    shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the "TIMES OF THE GENTILES”.
    Paul referring to this in Rom.11:25-27 said, “For I would not, brethren
    that ye should be ignorant of this mystery..." On May 14th, 1948 Israel
    re-gathered in a portion of Palestine to be the independent state of
    Israel.

    <strong>2) </strong>
    <strong>Perilous Times (2Tim 3:1-7)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    A look at all our societies today, we see that almost all the countries of
    the world have shown depravity in the above passage. We have in all our
    societies’ today selfishness, sexual perverseness, crime, violence, lack of
    conscience and rebellion against the word of God. This signifies the
    imminent coming of the Lord.

    <strong>The Rise of Russia</strong>

<p class="article"> 
    The Prophet Ezekiel in Ezek. 38:2,3: 39:1 describes a nation that will come
    against Israel after coming back to them.
    <br/>
    The Hebrew Rosh is chief in the Authorized. Rosh in the passage is Russia,
    Meshech is Moscow while Tubul is Tobolsk. Russia became a world power with
    a goal of world conquest after World War 1 in 1917.

    <strong>Armaments And Modern War Potential</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Just before Jesus returns with His saints to claim His kingdom, the earth
    will be the scene of the greatest war of all time called "Armageddon". It
    will be the final conflict of this dispensation.

    In Daniel 12:4, we have, "But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the
    book until the TIME OF THE END, many shall run to and fro, and knowledge
    shall increase.” The rate at which people travel and move from one place to
    the other through water, air and land is at a high rate. The speed is so
    great that a lot of travels into the space would have been untracked. The
    quest and acquisition of knowledge today knows no bound, with a lot of
    inventions that are setting the pace for the rise of the Antichrist.

<p class="article">

    <strong>How To Overcome The Last Days Syndrome</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    1) Set your affections on things that are above (Col. 3:1-5). The Bible
    says, “If in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most
    miserable (1Cor.15:19). Christians should always live daily expecting the
    coming of the Lord.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    2) Be engaged in a productive and fruitful service in church evangelism and
    soul winning (John15:1-5). Fruitfulness is a proof of our being attached to
    the vine which is our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    3) Pray for a refill of the Holy Spirit for higher Christian experience and
    effective service.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    4) Be part of the fellowship in the church. There are some people who are
    in the church but not in Christ. The church is the body of Christ. Be a
    part of this body with a
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    notable function (Romans 12; Hebrews 19:25).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    5) Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers...2Cor. 6:14. Live a life that
    is separated from the world and worldliness.<strong></strong>

    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The signs of the second coming of Jesus Christ that will bring an end to
    this present world system are very much with us. We should not be like the
    five (5) foolish virgins that did not have enough oil in their lamps and
    missed going with the bridegroom.

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus describes the events leading up to His return in glory and to
    indicate signs of His return. He described the first half of the seven-year
    period preceding His second coming (Matt 24:4-8). That period is called the
    Seventieth Week of Daniel (Dan 9:27). (However, some premillenarians hold
    that Christ in Matt 24:4-8 spoke of general signs in the present Church Age
    and that the time of trouble begins at Mat. 24:9. Others hold that Christ
    spoke of general signs in Mat. 24:4-14, with the Tribulation beginning at
    v. 15.) The events described in verses 4-8 correspond somewhat to the seven
    seals in Rev. 6. “That period will be characterized by (a) false Christs
    (Matt 24:4-5; cf. Rev 6:1-2; the first seal is Antichrist), (b) wars and
    rumors of wars (Matt 24:6; cf. Rev 6:3-4; the second seal is warfare) in
    which nations will rise up against each other on a global scale (Matt. 24:7
    a), and (c) unusual disturbances in nature including famines (v. 7 b; cf.
    Rev 6:3-6; the third seal is famine; the fourth and fifth seals are death
    and martyrdom [Rev 6:7-11]) and earthquakes (Matt. 24:7 b; cf. Rev 6:12-14;
    the sixth seal is an earthquake). These things, Jesus said, will be the
    beginning of birth pains. As a pregnant woman's birth pains indicate that
    her child will soon be born, so these universal conflicts and catastrophes
    will mean the end of this interadvent Age is near.”
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In Matthew 24:9-14, Jesus declared a time word. Also the gospel of the
    kingdom will be preached in the whole world during this period as a
    testimony to all nations. Though this will be a terrible time of
    persecution, the Lord will have servants who will witness and spread the
    good news concerning Christ and His soon-coming kingdom. Their message will
    clearly identify Jesus in His true character as the coming Messiah.

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Great Tribulation is one of the events of the last days predicted in
    the Bible. If we try to place it in chronological order of the events
    marking this period, it is the second to the last major events that will
    mark the end of human history as we know it today. It will be followed by
    the revelation of Christ leading to the war of Armageddon as this present
    age passes away to give room to the coming age in which Christ, with his
    saints, will rule the world in the millennium. Also, the Great Tribulation
    period is a judgement of God upon the world that has consistently rejected
    God and the provision of redemption that God has made through the sacrifice
    of our Lord Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Timing – Convergence Of Prophecies</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is no more a secret to many Bible believing Christians that we are deep
    into the period the Bible has identified to us as the LAST DAYS. The
    general happenings in the world which have been brought vividly to us by
    the headlines of the news media have proved the veracity as well as the
    authenticity of Biblical prophecies. The major significant outstanding
    prophetic event today is the great tribulation. This corresponds to the
    seventieth week of Daniel’s prophecy of chapter 9:24-27. From here, we
    understand that the specific period of the great tribulation will be
    ushered in with the signing of a seven year treaty between the Antichrist
    and the nation of Israel. Anytime this event occurs, then the world has
    entered into the Great Tribulation time and it will be culminated by the
    second coming of Christ leading to the war of Armageddon.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Events</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The events marking the Great Tribulation are well articulated in many Bible
    passages both in the Old and New Testaments. An attempt to peruse through
    these passages will be too voluminous for this lesson. However, those
    Christian denominations that accept the futuristic interpretation to the
    book of Revelation (like the Foursquare Movement), generally agree that
    Revelation 6:1-19:11 refers majorly to the many events that would
    characterize the Great Tribulation period. One can also peruse the second
    letter of Paul to the Thessalonians as recorded in chapter 2:1-12. Not to
    be neglected are the Lord Jesus’ sayings referring to the specific time of
    the Great Tribulation in Matthew 24: 15-31. We can also see Daniel 7:8-15,
    19-27; 9:27. The major outlines of events that can be glimpsed from these
    and other passages are:
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (i) The signing of the 7 years peace treaty between the Antichrist and
    Israel, which actually opens us to the specific period of the Great
    Tribulation. Everything that will be experienced in the world before this
    event will just be part of the last days events and the distress upon the
    nations of the world.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (ii) The world would celebrate the Antichrist during the first three and a
    half years of the Great Tribulation as if he is the expected messiah.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (iii) When the Jews would realize his true colour and refuse to acknowledge
    him as God, he will break the treaty and then unleash the worst and
    greatest persecution ever on the Jews as the chosen people of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (iv) As this is going on, God Himself, will be raining his judgement on the
    world as seen in the breaking of the seals, the trumpets and the bowls;
    judgements of the book of Revelation.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    (v) Among other things, the Antichrist will force people to receive his
    mark. The people without the mark, will not be able to buy or sell at this
    period and this will lead to the death of many people who will be accepting
    Christ at this time. This group of people are the tribulation saints who
    have to be martyred for their faith in Christ (Rev. 6:9-11, 7:9-17,
    15:1-4). Also, the Bible revealed that all who will accept the mark of the
    Antichrist shall be dammed forever (Rev. 14:9-11). With the terrible
    Judgement of God and the Satan inspired administration of the Antichrist at
    the time of the Great Tribulation (Rev. 13:1-2), no reasonable Christian
    will ever pray to be left behind after the rapture. The Great Tribulation
    period ends with Christ coming with his saints to deliver Israel from the
    annihilation policy of the Antichrist, fights the battle of Armageddon,
    imprisons Satan and his hordes of demons and establishes the millennium
    (Rev 19:11-20:4).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Purpose And Significance Of The Great Tribulation</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In the eternal purpose of God, the Great Tribulation serves to purify and
    weed off the Jewish nation from all rebels and their rebellion towards God
    and cause them to repent from their unbelief and their rejection of Christ
    at his first advent. Thus, preparing them to enter the millennium as loyal
    subjects of the kingdom with its capital at Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37-39).
    Also, God allows this period for the ungodly world and the prince of this
    world to see the result of their continued disobedience and rejection of
    God and the loving provision of his redemption in Christ that he has made
    available to them (Rev.9:20-21, 16:9,11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sin will always attract its dire consequences. Despite the loving grace of
    God, men continue to spurn his love and reject his offer of salvation.
    Instead of repenting, they stubbornly continue in their godlessness and
    lawlessness. God has decided to judge sin wherever it is found. The Great
    Tribulation is the resultant effect on a world that has put God out of its
    equation. We, as believers, need to constantly pray to God to keep us from
    the degeneration of the age (Matthew 24:12&amp;13). We must not only live a
    holy life, we must intercede for unbelievers and do all in our power by the
    grace that the Holy Spirit supplies to bring the Gospel to many, just as
    God has been gracious to us that through the faithfulness of some
    Christians, the Lord has been merciful to us too (Ezekiel 33:1-8).

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Despite the various views on eschatological events, the Bible gives us a
    great deal of information on God’s plan for the ages to come such that we
    can teach on it with confidence and great certainty. Also, the general
    outline of events can be grasped by the ardent Bible student. It will be
    advisable to read the passages outlined in more than one version. Effective
    use can be made of The Living Bible, The Message and The Amplified Bible
    with other modern English translations in order to come to a clearer
    understanding of the relevant passages.

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Most of the modern day rejection of the Bible and the God of the Bible is
    based on the immutable truth expressed in the Scriptures that there is only
    one way of salvation and the fact that men will give account of their lives
    to God. To the incorrigibles, this is not acceptable. All they want is the
    liberty to do whatsoever they like without any form of restraint or caution
    of afterlife accountability. This is part of the lies and deceits fashioned
    from the pit of hell to make human beings to be careless and carefree as to
    the eternal destiny of their souls. Another lie that has been perpetuated
    among believers today is the over-emphasis on the grace of God in Christ
    Jesus that tells the child of God that once you have accepted Christ as
    your Lord and Saviour, your sins that you have committed, and those which
    you may ever commit have been paid for. While this is true, the effect of
    it is that the needed watchfulness necessary for a sober life is removed
    and thus equating the need for practical holiness as walking or living in
    the law (I Cor.5:9-13, 6:9-11).
</p>

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Certainty Of God’s Judgement</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The Scripture is full of the expressions of God’s judgements over sin right
    from the moment that Adam and Eve fell from their state of innocence due to
    disobedience to God’s law. God’s dealings with men as revealed in the Bible
    indicate to us that every form of disobedience to the express will of God
    will always incur God’s wrath and judgement. God has made it clear to us in
    his Word that sin is a terrible thing and as a holy and righteous God,
    there is no way he can close his eyes to it whenever and wherever it occurs
    (Hab.1:13; Prov.1:22-33; Ecc.9:9-10, 12:9-14; Romans 2:1-11).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In order to show his mercy to the sinful man, God brought the Judgement of
    our sins on the Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself as a propitiation for
    our sin that we can receive God’s mercy and forgiveness. Someone was made
    to pay the terrible price for our sins in order for God to show his love
    for us. This great unfathomable love should not make us to take God for
    granted. This attitude will not benefit us as the Bible reveals
    (Heb.10:26-39, 6:1-8). Our greatest love for God is in doing his will.
    However, if we mistakenly sin, we should not allow the enemy to mock us.
    All we need to do is to get back to God and allow the blood to cleanse us
    as we repent and forsake such sins (I John 1:5-2:2).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>The Various Judgements</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God’s Judgement on sin is death (Gen. 2:15-17, 3:15-19). This is both
    spiritual as well as physical. The first passage quoted above indicates
    spiritual death and the second passage indicates physical death. Spiritual
    death is the separation from God even when one is alive. One is cut-off
    from the life of God. In the present dispensation anyone outside of Christ
    is spiritually dead even though he may still be breathing. Spiritual death
    describes the condition of all men born through Adam until they are
    regenerated by the Spirit of God through faith in Christ Jesus. This is the
    reason why the Bible says that anyone who rejects the offer of grace
    through Jesus Christ is condemned already. The wrath of God abides on Him
    perpetually. For any man to reject Christ in this world until he dies
    (physical death), his state of spiritual death remains forever as he
    proceeds to hell to suffer a total and an eternal separation from God.
    Physical death is the lot of all men due to Adam’s rebellion.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    However, all those who belong to Jesus Christ will share in his victory
    over the grave as he will resurrect them to eternal life in a glorified
    body and to live with him forever. Therefore, the Judgement of God upon sin
    is both spiritual death and physical death. Spiritual death is the lot of
    all men through Adam, and this defines the state of all people outside of
    Christ unless they take advantage of God’s provision of salvation and are
    regenerated and become alive unto God by the power of the Holy Spirit.
    Physical death, which the Bible described as our greatest enemy has been
    defeated by the Lord Jesus Christ by his resurrection from the dead and all
    who belong to him shall share in this victory.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>The Two Eternal Destinations</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Divine Judgement upon sin has predestined two places of eternal abode for
    all his moral creatures (both men and angels). These are hell and heaven.
    Hell, the Bible revealed, will be the abode of Satan and all the angels
    that joined him in his rebellion against God in heaven. Also, all men that
    reject God’s offer of salvation in Christ Jesus shall be turned into hell
    where God made initially for the devil and his angels. The choice is for
    the individual to decide. Heaven is the abode of God. This has been
    destined to be the abode for all the faithful angels who did not join the
    devil in his rebellion. Even though they are presently there with him now,
    they will continue to live with God forever for all eternity. Also, all the
    redeemed of the Lord who have accepted God’s offer of salvation in Christ
    shall be there with him forever.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion and Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The fact of God’s Judgement upon sin is a comfort to the redeemed of the
    Lord for all eternity to come. It is the prerogative of God’s mercy, love
    and grace that brought salvation to mankind as a lost race in Adam.
    However, this grace teaches us that we should say “No” to ungodliness and
    worldly passions and to live self-controlled, upright lives in this present
    age (Titus 2:11&amp;12). The impunity with which men are transgressing the
    laws of God, rejecting his offer of salvation in Christ and also
    persecuting God’s people makes the Judgement upon sin inevitable (2
    Thessalonians 1:3-10). It also serves to reinforce the resolve of the
    believers to continue to live for God’s glory as each person will give an
    account of all his actions to the Creator who has given us the privilege of
    life (Revelation 22:11&amp;12).

    Encourage the students to read all Bible passages cited. Give adequate time
    for reflection. God’s Judgement is not only for unbelievers. The saints
    will be judged also as indicated in I Cor. 5:10 as to all that we have done
    in the body. We should also note however that when we continue to do like
    the unbelievers, live a life without restraint, and we become carnal, we
    cannot hide under the grace of Jesus Christ to avert the Judgement of God
unless we repent before it is too late ( Ezekiel 18:24-32; Gal.5:16-21).    <strong></strong>

    <em>
        We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deep sorrow and
        unquenchable fire, which was not prepared for man, but for the devil
        and his angels: it will become the place of eternal separation from God
        for all who reject Christ as Saviour (Matt.13:41, 42; Rev.20:10, 15).

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As it has been pointed in the last lesson, the Bible revealed to us that
    hell is a place God created for the devil and the other angels who joined
    him in his rebellion against the almighty God (Matt. 25:31-46). However,
    all men who rejected God’s provision of salvation in Christ Jesus and all
    who rejected God’s rule in their lives will also find themselves in hell.
    The great sacrifice God made for in Christ Jesus is such that no man will
    ever find himself in hell (John 3:16-18, 36).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>The Awesome Mystery of Life</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Many have wondered why such a loving God as our Father in heaven will
    consign people to hell when these ones do not actually ask to be created or
    be born. The answer lies in the fact that the gift of life is a marvellous
    and glorious privilege. It flows from the bosom of a loving God who has
    bonded Himself to cater for all whom he has brought to existence. Every
    moral creature of God (man or angel) was created that they may forever
    share the blessing of an eternal joy, love, grace and peace with Him (Psalm
    119:68, 138; Rev. 4:11). Judging from the great length that our Father went
    in order to save mankind from the terrible effect of sin through the
    sacrifice of Jesus, the worth of a human soul to God is of an inestimable
    value and very precious (Matt.16:26; Mark 8:36&amp;37; Psalm 49:7-9; Jer.
    29:11). It is thus the height of ingratitude for any moral creature to
    treat the privilege of life with levity.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Jesus’ Description of Hell</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The revelation of hell as a place of torment came from the graphic
    description of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ that he gave to us in the
    classic story of Lazarus and the rich man recorded for us in Luke16:19-31.
    Apart from the mention of hell in many passages of the Scripture, it is
    this classic story that highlighted the reality of immortality of the soul,
    the consciousness of souls after leaving the body, the fact of different
    places for the righteous and the wicked between death and the resurrection
    of the body and the truth of torment for the wicked and bliss for the
    righteous. Many religionists would like to regard this story as a parable;
    however Jesus here mentioned the specific name of Lazarus indicating that
    it is an actual experience. A careful reading of the chapter in verses
    22&amp;23 shows that this is an after-life experience. Both men died. While
    Lazarus was carried by angels to paradise (Abraham’s bosom), the rich man
    having been buried, he consciously lifted his eyes in hell. In the Old
    Testament, the word translated as hell is the Hebrew word ‘sheol’ which
    means the place of the dead, the unseen world, the place of departed
    spirits after they leave the bodies at physical death. This same word was
    translated as grave and also as pit. In the King James Version, sheol is
    translated as hell, 31 times, as grave 31 times, and as pit, 3 times. It is
    this different translations that sometimes obscure the true meaning of
    sheol. The New Testament equivalent of sheol is Hades. This word is
    translated as hell, ten times and grave, one time. The many passages on
    hell revealed in the Bible indicate that it is a place reserved for the
    wicked and those who have rejected Christ and those who reject the rule of
    God in their lives.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Clarifying Immortality</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We should know that resurrection refers only to the bodies of all men who
    died, and not to the souls and spirits which are immortal. All scriptures
    on future resurrection of the dead, without exception, refer only to the
    bodies which die and will be resurrected from dust again. (See the
    followings: Dan. 12:2; John 5:28-29; I Cor. 15; I Thes.4:13-17; Rev.
    20:4-6, 11-15). There will be no spiritual resurrection, that is, a
    resurrection of the soul and spirit. All spiritual resurrection is
    accomplished in this life before the body dies (Eph. 2;1-10; Col.2:11-13).
    If one is not resurrected spiritually from death in trespasses and sin in
    this life, he will remain spiritually dead or separated from God (Heb.9:27;
    Rev. 20:11-15). All scriptures mentioning future immortality refer to the
    body, not the soul, which is now and will forever be immortal.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is upon our acceptance of Christ as our Lord and Saviour that our
    spirits become regenerated and made alive unto God by the express work of
    the Holy Spirit Himself. This is not possible by any reformation of
    character by man. Until that regenerating work of the Holy Spirit is done
    in the lives of men, all are dead in trespasses and sin spiritually even
    though they are living a normal life as a man. Thus any man who rejected
    Christ is separated from God in this life and will forever be separated
    from him when he dies physically in that condition. Any man thus separated,
    will be cast into hell for his name will be missing from the Lamb’s book of
    life (Rev. 20:11-15, 21:27).

</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Many of the confusions arising from the issue of life after death stem from
    the way many Bible translators translated the word “sheol” in the Old
    Testament. The word for “grave” in Hebrew is “qeber” and is always
    translated grave, burying place or sepulchre. It is never translated as
    hell and this is very correct. At death, a man’s body is buried in the
    grave while his soul and spirit either goes to heaven, if he has already
    been regenerated by the Holy Spirit or to hell if he dies in his trespasses
    and sin.

        If we want to understand the Old Testament, we must understand the
        Exodus. As we celebrate Christmas this year, we take note of the
        dedication of Jesus by Mary and Joseph. The couple’s obedience to the
        law for their firstborn son gave a unique occasion for a prophetic

    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Remembering Redemption -Exodus 13:13b-15</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God commanded Moses to communicate to the children of Israel the law of
    dedication and redemption of the first son,
    <strong>
        <em>
            “… and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou
            redeem.” (Ex 13:13).
        </em>
    </strong>
    The firstborn sons and male animals were to be dedicated to the LORD (Num
    18:15). Because human sacrifice was unacceptable the Hebrews' sons were
    commanded to be "redeemed." (Ex 12:26-27; 13:8). The Egyptian firstborn
    were slain, in judgment, while God spared the children of Israel. The
    consecration of the firstborn was a sign and symbol, a reminder of God's
    powerful and gracious deliverance from the land of bondage.
</p>

    This explains the significance of the firstborn in the nation of Israel.
    Not only once a year at Passover were the Jews reminded of God's grace and
    power, but each time a first-born male, man or beast, came into the world,
    that firstborn issue had to be redeemed. All the firstborn belonged to God.
    They were sanctified, that is, set apart for God's exclusive possession.
    Moses explained how it should be handled (Lev 12; Num. 18:14-19). Parents
    were to bring their firstborn sons to the Lord and offer the appropriate
    sacrifice (Lev 12:6-8). When Mary and Joseph came to the temple to redeem
    the Redeemer, they brought the humble sacrifice as demanded by the Law of
    Moses (Luke 2:21-24).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When a firstborn son was redeemed, it gave adults the opportunity to
    explain how God had rescued the first-born in the land of Goshen on
    Passover night, and how He had slain all the Egyptian first-born, both
    humans and livestock. Every firstborn son in a Jewish family was very
    special to the parents and to the Lord.
</p>

    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Anticipating Redemption -Luke 2:22-24</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day according to the Jewish ordinance
    (Gen 17:12). The law also provided for the purification of the mother after
    forty days (Lev 12) and the redemption of their firstborn (Ex 13:1-12).
    Jesus fulfilled the Law (fulfilling all righteousness).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus was brought to Jerusalem, to present Him to the Lord. All the
    first-born males had been claimed as "holy to the Lord," or set apart to
    sacred uses. This was in memory of the deliverance of the first-born of
    Israel from destruction in Egypt, through the sprinkling of blood (Ex
    13:2). It was in obedience to the "law of Moses," that Joseph and Mary
    presented their baby unto the Lord, 'in the east gate of the court called
    Nicanor's Gate, where she herself would be sprinkled by the priest with the
    blood of her sacrifice'. However, this was a shadow of what to come, in due
    time, we were to be redeemed,
    <strong>
        <em>
            "not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the
            precious blood of Christ" (1 Peter 1:18-19).
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In obedience to the law, they offered a sacrifice according to that which
    is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves, or two young
    pigeons. The proper sacrifice was a lamb for a burnt offering, and a
    turtle-dove or young pigeon for a sin offering. But if a lamb could not be
    afforded, the mother was to bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons;
    and if even this was beyond the family means, then a portion of fine flour,
    but without the usual fragrant accompaniments of oil and frankincense,
    because it represented a sin offering (Lev. 12:6-8; 5:7-11). From this we
    gather that our Lord's parents were in poor circumstances (2 Cor. 8:9), and
    yet not in abject poverty; as they neither brought the lamb, nor availed
    themselves of the provision for the poorest, but presented the intermediate
    offering of "a pair of turtle-doves, or two young pigeons."
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Celebrating Redemption -Luke 2:25-32</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    When baby Jesus was presented at the temple in Jerusalem, there was a
    remnant of believing Jews, waiting for their Redeemer (Luke2: 25-32, 38);
    Simeon and Anna were among them. The Spirit of God both taught and led
    Simeon, so he was right there when Mary and Joseph came with their baby.
    The remarkable thing about his hymn of praise is that he included the
    Gentiles! He was now ready to die because he had seen the Messiah with his
    own eyes. Simeon blessed God, and he also blessed Mary and Joseph; but he
    did not bless the baby, because Jesus is the source of every blessing. Mary
    did feel "the sword" in her heart repeatedly as she watched her Son during
    His ministry and then stood at the cross where He died (John 19:25-27).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Mary and Joseph marvelled by the words of Simeon. Though they had been told
    that their Son was the Messiah, perhaps they had not comprehended the scope
    of His ministry (to the entire world - to the Gentiles as well as to the
    people of Israel). Simeon revealed to Mary that her Son would be opposed (a
    sign... spoken against) and that she would be hurt greatly (Luke 2:34-35).
    Her grief would be like a sword piercing her soul. The Son would cause the
    falling and rising of many in Israel. Throughout His ministry Jesus
    proclaimed that the only way to the kingdom, something the nation had long
    sought, was to follow Him. The ones who did so would receive salvation;
    they would "rise." But the ones who did not believe Him would not receive
    salvation; they would "fall". Simeon came by the Spirit into the temple,
    probably to fulfil the prophecy of Malachi 3:1, “The Lord, whom ye seek,
    shall suddenly come to his temple”- a light of the Gentiles.

<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application:</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    God delivered the ordinance of dedication and redemption of the firstborn
    son to the children of Israel for implementation in the land of promise (Ex
    13:11). The firstborn sons and male animals were to be dedicated to the
    LORD (Num. 18:15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    We learnt from the example of Christ's conformity to that aspect of the
    law. Viewed simply in the light of obedience, He has left us an example
    that we should follow His steps (1 Peter 2:21). But as He was made under
    the law only to redeem them that were under the law, His obedience was more
    than voluntary -it was strictly self- imposed obedience; and since it is by
    the obedience of this One that many are made righteous (Rom 5:19), it had
    throughout, and in every part of it, a substitutionary character, which
    made it altogether unique. The glorious child of God was born in a lowly
    state. The earthly parents were so poor that they could not afford a lamb
    for a burnt offering on His presentation in the temple. So, our poor
    background should not have negative influence on us or hinder our vision.

<p class="article"> 
    In the law of redemption, animals were included because "they too benefited
    from the redemption which God provided in the 10th plague". Since donkeys
    were considered ceremonially unclean animals (Lev 11:2-4) they could not be
    sacrificed, but they could be redeemed, "to buy back for a price" by lambs
    sacrificed in their place. Furthermore, since human sacrifice was
    unacceptable, the Hebrews' sons were also to be "redeemed" (Ex 12:26-27;
    13:8). When the Egyptian firstborn sons were slain in judgment, the
    Israelite firstborn sons were redeemed by animals- an act of
    substitutionary sacrifice or redemption (for the sons). Concerning the
    Jewish race, one whole tribe, that of Levi, was accepted, and set apart to
    occupations exclusively sacred (Num 3:11-38). It was in obedience to this
    "law of Moses," that Mary presented her baby (Jesus).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Jesus established the Lord's Supper after He had led His disciples in
    celebrating Passover, for He is the fulfilment of the Passover as the Lamb
    of God who died for the sins of the world. Each time we share in the Lord's
    Supper, we look back and remember His death, and we also look ahead in
    anticipation of His coming again. When Jesus returns, a wonderful exodus
    will take place! The dead in Christ will be raised and the living believers
    will be caught up with them and taken to heaven to be with the Lord (1
    Thess. 4:13-18). Hallelujah, what a Saviour! <strong></strong>

    <strong>Lesson Commentary</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The import of this lesson is a stark reminder that this world is not our
    home but heaven is our home. We are but strangers and pilgrims, or put in
    another way round, pilgrim and sojourners on earth (Heb. 11:13). Simply
    put, we are tenants in this world, and our sojourn is not forever. By way
    of analogy, it is comparable to a farmer, who goes to his farm early in the
    morning. At sunset, after the day’s enervating tilling of the land, he
    returns to his hut for a sweet rest, to recuperate his exhausted energy and
    enjoy his delicious meal. Thus, bearing this in mind, we should live
    soberly, while in our home on earth, do the good we can do without
    prevarication or vacillation. We should work while it is day time, for the
    night comes when nobody can work (John 9:4). This makes it imperative for
    us to bear in mind Ps. 90:12, to wit, “Teach us to number our days that we
    may gain a heart of wisdom.” We need to gain a heart of wisdom so as to
    know that our citizenship is in heaven! (Philip 3:20)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>I. </strong>
    <strong>Our Present Home On Earth (2Corin. 5:1-8 John 14:1-2)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our present earthly home is highly vulnerable. It is full of many deceivers
    (II John 7) who do not teach the true doctrine, thus, turning away people’s
    mind from Jesus Christ as the One who came in the flesh. It is also full of
    false prophets (I John 4:1) who prophesy out of their own imaginations.
    They deceive, they lie and they seduce to turn the hearts of the
    inhabitants of the earthly home from God. Just like sly foxes find homes
    among the ruins of cities, so also the false prophets find profit in our
    present home on earth (Ezek. 13:3). Our present home on earth is one that
    is permeated with evil (Hab. 1:3). It is one full of violence, strife,
    contentions, injustice and lawlessness. The wicked take delight/ relish in
    oppressing the righteous. Our present home on earth is akin to “poor
    cottages of clay”, in which our souls dwell, which are decaying, and whose
    foundations are in the dust, and susceptible to destruction without prior
    notification.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It is therefore not surprising that in this earthly home, believers are
    groaning, a groaning of sorrow under a heavy burden of load. Our earthly
    home is also one situated in a “wicked and perverse” environment.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    As believers we are pilgrims and strangers in the world (Heb. 11:13). We
    sojourn here in our earthly home, walking by faith and not by sight, as we
    earnestly yearn for our home in heaven.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The troubles of this earthly home are diverse. We have worries of life
    (Matt: 6:25). We also have the worries of tomorrow (Matt 6:34). These
    worries make our spirits to be troubled, our souls to be troubled, as well
    as our hearts to be relentlessly troubled!
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>II. </strong>
    <strong>Glimpse Of Our Home In Heaven (John 14:1-6; Rev. 7:15-17)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Our Lord Jesus Christ told us, as His followers, when He told His disciples
    that Heaven is their everlasting rest (John 14:2)
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    He said he was going to prepare the place for them. This implies that our
    home is in heaven, and not on this earth where we are presently. Christ
    also said that He would certainly come back in due time, to fetch the
    disciples which also includes us as His believers to that blessed place
    which He was going to possess for Himself and prepare for us (John 14: 3).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The question now arises as to how this home in heaven looks like, that we
    have to be “specially” prepared to be put in possession of it. From the
    lenses and hopes of a believer, heaven is perceived as a ‘House’ or
    ‘Habitation’.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The heavenly home is a place of joyful service, and not of suffering (Rev.
    7:15). It is also a home where the inhabitants are happy in their freedom
    from all the inconveniences experienced by the inhabitants of the earthly
    home. The Lord Jesus Christ ensures that we will have in possession
    everything that is pleasant to our souls. Thus, we shall no longer
    experience hunger and thirst. For the Great Provider will provide for all
    their needs through His riches in glory (Philip 4:19; Rev.7:17). Need we
    say more, except to add that the occupants of this heavenly home will also
    be free from all forms of sickness and pain? They are never to be scourged
    by the heat of the sun anymore (Rev. 7:16). The book of Revelation chapter
    7 tells us that those whose home is in heaven are those that see themselves
    as being in low and desolate state (Matt.5) but because they are pure in
    heart and hunger and thirst after righteousness (Matt. 5: 8, 6) they become
    the possessors of the home in heaven.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Another trademark of the inhabitants of the heavenly home is that they had
    been persecuted by men for no just purpose. But the good thing is that as
    good and faithful followers of Christ, they did not suffer in vain, since
    their suffering was not for murder or stealing and they did not suffer for
    being evil doers, or for being busy-bodies in other men’s matters (I Pet.
    4:15).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    It must be stressed however, that the way to the home in heaven is not a
    smooth one, but one that is bumpy and “tarred” with many tribulations. But
    when successfully passed through, it will make the Home in heaven more
    glorious and more comfortably welcome.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    From the foregoing glimpses, it is manifestly clear that our Home in heaven
    is a place to be desired, a place to strive for with all ‘spiritual
    weapons’. It is a place to be prepared for with unrelenting vigour and
    undiminished determination.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>III. </strong>
    <strong>Need To, And How To Prepare For Our Home In Heaven (</strong>
    <strong>1 Thess. 5:1-9</strong>
    <strong>)</strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Having had a glimpse of what our home in heaven looks like in the preceding
    section, there is no need for planning to be there. Planning, in this
    sense, is deciding in advance what to do to be counted worthy of occupying
    our home in heaven.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In our text, Apostle Paul pointed out to us the uselessness or the
    needlessness of enquiring about the exact time of our being “asked to come”
    and occupy the mansion. He disclosed that the “call” will be sudden and
    terrible for the wicked, but joyfully comfortable for the righteousness
    (Saint).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The following should be our guide in planning for our home in heaven.
    First, we should be watchful and be sober.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Second, we should exercise faith, love and hope. That is, we are admonished
    to live by faith, so as to remain watchful and sober.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Third, we should not indulge in spiritual sloth and idleness.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Fourth, we must be on guard against sin and temptation to sin.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Fifth, we should be well armed, by putting on the whole armour of God.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Sixth, we must get a heart inflamed with love.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Seventh, we should be on our knees often, praying without ceasing (I Thess.
    5:17) without fainting and without weariness.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Eight, we must be careful not to quench the Holy Spirit (vs. 19).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Ninth, we should abstain from every appearance of evil and from being
    deceived by false doctrines (vs 22).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Tenth, we should abstain from sin, and everything that looks like sin,
    leads to sin and borders on sin.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Eleventh, we should endeavour to maintain purity of heart and integrity of
    life.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    Twelfth, we should beware of false teachers, who are hypocrites and liars!
    (I Tim. 4:1-2). Preparations is inexhaustible, it will not be out of place
    to supplement with a few more. Any believer, yearning for the upward call
    to the everlasting home in heaven, must turn from godless living. He must
    also turn from sinful pleasures and lusts like lust of the flesh, lust of
    the eye, and pride of life (II John 2:15-16).
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    <strong>Conclusion &amp; Life Application </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    This lesson is to arouse us from our spiritual slumber and spiritual
    lethargy. It is to make us to be on our guard, because we don’t know what
    day the Lord will come “for the Son of Man will come when least expected.”
    Therefore, we must be prepared at all time. For us to get prepared, the
    lesson is divided into three inter-related sections. The first section is a
    brief but insightful analysis of our present home on earth, pointing out
    that our sojourn therein is brief and snappy. The second section is a
    pre-bird’s eye-view of what our home in heaven looks like. It points out
    some of the “goodies” therein as our “everlasting home.
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    The third section is about planning to take possession of the home in
    Heaven, as a “palace that far excels all the palaces on earth” including
    that of wise and famous king Solomon of the Old Testament fame. This
    section gives a full insight into what sort of planning and preparations to
    be made so as to be found worthy, and so as not to be caught unawares,
    panting profusely. <strong></strong>

    <strong>Teaching Overview/Insight </strong>
</p>
<p class="article"> 
    In teaching this lesson, our students should be asked to distinguish
    between the characteristic features of the home on earth vis-à-vis the home
    in heaven. They should also be asked to take stock of the behavioural and
    attitudinal dispositions of the present inhabitants of the earthly home.
    They should be asked to put this side by side with the characteristic
    features of the heavenly home earlier undertaken. Let them judge if such
    behaviour is suitable for, or qualifies one for the everlasting home in
    heaven. What adjustments, if any, should be effected to our present
    spiritual life-style to qualify us as worthy possessor or occupant of this
    everlasting home of joy in heaven. Ask the students to engage in a critical
    self-examination of their spiritual life-style to determine what areas they
    need to change or adjust, so as to make them worthy as faithful followers
    of Christ, destined for the everlasting home in heaven.<strong></strong>
